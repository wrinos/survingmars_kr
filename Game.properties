Still, the thin Martian atmosphere dictates that the average wind turbine would need winds around six times more powerful than those on Earth to create the same amount of thrust.@n @nThis technological challenge to take advantage of what little wind there is on Mars was solved by opting for vertical axis wind turbines, which are capable of catching the wind from all directions, instead of simply horizontal.  The materials used are light enough to self-start on much weaker forces than those most commonly used on Earth.

3980코0=Buildings
1152코0=BUILDINGS
5373코0=The Martian Colony is made up of a variety of buildings which provide power, life-support, comfort, protection from the weather, information, resources and a lot more - all things without which humans cannot exist on the red planet.@n@nBuildings are built by using Martian resources while some can be brought from Earth as prefab buildings. All buildings, however, require a resource upkeep for maintenance. @n@nA construction site must be within the <em>Service Area</em> of <em>Drones</em> (relative to their control hubs) in order to receive the resources needed and then erected.@n@nSome buildings require Power to operate, other are staffed by Colonists living nearby.@n@nThe <em>Performance</em> of any building indicates how effectively the building is performing its primary function. It depends on many factors such as researched technologies, upgrades and the current individual performance of the specific colonists working in the building. Qualified specialists and workers with high Morale will increase the performance of a building, while empty work slots, Renegades and workers with low Morale or other issues will be detrimental.@n@nBuildings can be set to operate in three <em>Work Shifts</em> - first, second and night. Turning off some Work Shifts will conserve power and workforce. 
3983코0=Disasters
5374코0=DISASTERS
5375코0=Mars is a harsh environment and human life is only made possible due to incredibly durable structures - designed specifically to resist it.@n@nEvery now and then, however, extremes will appear that will test the resilience of the colony on a much higher level.
5376코0=Mars is infamous for its large and sometimes quite lengthy Dust Storms which raise so much dust that they can be seen with telescopes from Earth. While the wind speeds reached during these storms are not quite dangerous, taking into consideration that Mars’s atmosphere is but 1% of Earth’s, the sheer amount of dust raised can knock field machinery out of order until fixed.@n@nAnother issue is that Mars’s fine dust particles are extremely dry and slightly electrostatic, which can cause damage to our electrical grid if a dust storm with more electrostatic properties appears.@n@nMOXIEs and Moisture Vaporators do not function during dust storms.@n@nDust Storms suspend air traffic - all shuttles will finish their final courses and then return to their hubs until the storm passes.@n@nElectrostatic Dust Storms are a rare occurrence. Lightning strikes during such storms can shutdown buildings for a time or drain the batteries of our drones and rovers. @n@nThe greater the risk the Dust Storm is flagged to pose in an area, the higher the chance is for an Electrostatic Dust Storm to appear. Dust storms can also be a seasonal event, happening routinely in the most high risk areas.
4146코0=Meteors
5377코0=Meteors are extremely common in the solar system. Every day, small to medium sized meteors hit the Earth but most burn out quickly in the atmosphere without ever reaching the surface. Mars, on the other hand, has a very thin atmosphere and most meteors reach the surface. This is, sadly, a constant threat, and must be taken into consideration when designing our colonies. Domes can mostly withstand direct hits with manageable damage, but all buildings outside the protection of Domes are vulnerable. @n@nRedundancy in vital lifelines such as Water and Oxygen support is one way of risk management.
5378코0=Martian surface temperatures are freezing at best while being extremely cold most of the time. Although humans can’t withstand the Martian cold outside <em>Domes</em> (not without protective gear), most of our machinery is designed to function effortlessly in the cold. @nThis, however, is subject to change when a weather event known as a Cold Wave appears. The low-density Martian atmosphere allows for rapid and dramatic temperature drops – drops so low, that all field buildings have to spend increased amounts of electrical Power to keep from succumbing to the cold. @n@nCold Waves appear with a short warning period and also may be e seasonal event in areas of Mars flagged as being especially cold.@n@nDuring a Cold Wave all <em>Water Tanks</em> freeze solid - rendering the colony somewhat vulnerable to water shortages if more unfortunate events overlap.@n@nOut-dome buildings left without power also run the risk of freezing until the cold wave subsides or the area is heated via a Subsurface Heater. Buildings that have an inactive shift are very likely to freeze during that shift.
4142코0=Dust Devils
5379코0=Dust Devils form when hot gases near the ground rise quickly through a small pocket of cooler, low-pressure gases above it. They become a vortex of the dust and particles caught by these gases and form a visible pillar that moves and twists.@n@nMartian Dust Devils can be up to fifty times as wide and ten times as high as dust devils on Earth, and they pose a threat to any technology within their vicinity as they tend to cover everything around them with dust.
692코0=Resources
4270코0=RESOURCES
5380코0=Resources are either gathered directly from Mars, or later manufactured in resource production buildings – most commonly from other resources.@n@nThey keep the Colony operational by being used for life-support, construction and building upkeep. @n@nThere are two types of resources; <em>grid</em>  and <em>non-grid</em>.@n@nGrid resources use <em>Pipes</em> and <em>Cables</em> for distribution, while non-grid resources have to be moved around with <em>Drones</em> or <em>RC Rovers</em>.
3513코0=Concrete
5381코0=Concrete  <image UI/Icons/Sections/Concrete_1.tga>  is made by building <em>Concrete Extractors</em> on regolith deposits found all over the Martian surface. It is a basic building material and is used in a wide range of building types.@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nOn Mars, water is a rare and difficult to obtain commodity. As such, turning the Martian regolith into traditional, water based concrete was deemed unpractical very early on during the planning stages. Luckily, Mars is rich in another element with which a different type of concrete can be made – sulfur.@n@nSulfur-based, waterless concrete is literally the foundation for every aspiring Martian city. Concrete Extractors placed on spots rich in sulfur in the Martian soil, dig up the sulfur-rich regolith and store it as ready to use mix. It is later transported and heated by our <em>Drones</em> on construction sites, turning it into strong and enduring concrete.
5382코0=Power  <image UI/Icons/Sections/electricity_1.tga>  is generated from several power generation facilities and is then spread throughout the colony by cables. Excessive power can be stored in batteries for emergency situations.@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nElectrical power on Mars comes mostly from renewable and cheap sources such as wind power (<em>Wind Turbine</em>) and sunlight (<em>Solar Panel</em>), but also from fission (<em>Sterling Generator</em>) and fusion based sources (<em>Fusion Reactor</em>) as the technology available advances. It is then distributed via an extensive and durable cable network. @n@n<em> Power Switches</em> can be used to dynamically manage the flow of power in case of damaged cables or low power situations.
3517코0=Electronics
5383코0=Electronics <image UI/Icons/Sections/Electronics_1.tga> are manufactured in <em>Electronics Factories</em> from <em>Rare Metals</em> and are mainly used for vehicle operating buildings, like <em>Drone Hubs</em> and <em>Shuttle Hubs</em>. @n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nTechnology and electronics go hand in hand on Mars the same way as they have, and will continue to for centuries to come, on Earth.
1022코0=Food
5384코0=Food <image UI/Icons/Sections/Food_1.tga> is grown on <em>Farms</em> and <em>Hydroponic Farms</em>, which are placed inside <em>Domes</em>, and also <em>Fungal Farms</em> which are placed outside of Domes.@n@nFarms and Hydroponic Farms can grow different crops with different cycle patterns. Furthermore some crops, like Algae, also generate oxygen for the Dome they are grown in. @n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nMaking the Martian soil fit for farming, even within the protection of Domes, takes heavy alterations. First, toxin removers are applied to rid the Martian regolith of toxic substances like perchlorates. Then, the use of chemical decompressors to break down common Martian compounds and make nutrients out of them is employed. And finally, specifically designed bacteria to further modify all nutrients made into a more plant-use friendly form, is introduced. @n@nGrowing food on Mars greatly decreases costs and dependency on Earth.
4765코0=Fuel
5385코0=Fuel <image UI/Icons/Sections/Fuel_1.tga> is synthesized in <em>Fuel Refineries</em> and is used to for refueling <em>Rockets</em> bound for Earth, for keeping <em>Shuttle Hubs</em> operational and for polymer production.@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nUsing the CO2 from the Martian atmosphere and hydrogen (from water) we can produce fuel to fly our rockets back to Earth. The process uses a series of relatively simple chemical reactions to produce methane and oxygen which are used as propellant for both our rockets and shuttles.
5386코0=Machine Parts
5387코0=Machine Parts  <image UI/Icons/Sections/MachineParts_1.tga> are manufactured in <em>Machine Parts Factories</em> from <em>Metal</em> and are mainly used in both the construction and maintaining of the sophisticated resource Extractors on Mars.@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nBack on Earth, we humans are dependent on machines to sustain our advanced way of life; to power our industries and make possible our vast transportation systems. Here on Mars machines are also tasked with making life possible to begin with, on top of potentially maintaining all of their previous obligations.@n@nSmart design processes and accepted standards have made possible the stockpiling of Machine Parts that could be used in an array of instruments upon demand. Machine Parts could be delivered from Earth to meet the needs of any fledgling colony. But a hefty and reliable supply, one obtained only by having them manufactured on site, will be the foundation to bringing our Earthly way of life to the Martian dream city.
3514코0=Metals
5388코0=Metal  <image UI/Icons/Sections/Metals_1.tga>  is readily found on the Martian surface, deposited from ancient tectonic activity and meteor blasts. Further deposits can be found beneath the surface (by either <em>Orbital Probes</em> or <em>Sensor Towers</em>) which can be then mined with <em>Metal Extractors</em>.@n@nMetal is a basic building material and is used in a wide range of buildings. It is also used for manufacturing <em>Machine Parts</em>.@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nSince very early in human history, metals play a vital role in the art of creation. From simple copper tools and nails, to iron decorations to entire structures made out of steel. It would seem their role is not exhausted only on Earth, but will continue to serve as an accessible and vital resource for all our needs on Mars as well.
682코0=Oxygen
5389코0=Oxygen  <image UI/Icons/Sections/Oxygen_1.tga>  is essential for humans to linger and call Mars their home. It can be produced using the sophisticated <em>MOXIE</em> buildings, and later on naturally generated from crops.@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nOxygen is the most short term life support resource. If colonists are left without oxygen they will die extremely fast. And while Mars’s atmosphere has little to no Oxygen, what it does provide is an abundance of Carbon Dioxide, which our brilliant MOXIE technology can convert to the much needed Oxygen. @n@nLike water, it is supplied and distributed via pipes networks, in fact, sharing the same pipes used for water distribution.
3515코0=Polymers
5390코0=Polymers  <image UI/Icons/Sections/Polymers_1.tga>  can be naturally obtained from obsidian scattered on the Martian surface and, once colonists have settled, can also be synthesized in <em>Polymer Factories</em>. It is mainly used for the construction of power accumulators, <em>Domes</em> and Spires.@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nSome of the most important and widely used materials on Earth are made from polymers. While the dependency on such materials on Mars is artificially circumvented as much as possible due to the scarcity of the molecule (unlike Earth, Mars has no fossil fuel reserves to act as a polymer source), their importance cannot be avoided all together. Plastics, rubbers and more advanced isolations have a fundamental role to play in creating and maintaining pressure differentials between habitats and external areas.
4139코0=Rare Metals
5391코0=Rare metals  <image UI/Icons/Sections/PreciousMetals_1.tga>  are found only in underground deposit sites and need <em>Rare Metal Extractors</em> to mine them. They are mostly used for manufacturing electronics and for exporting back to Earth.@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nAfter millennia of acting as a status symbol, in modern times rare metals are widely used in electronics and for medical procedures. Still, although one of the vital elements of the Information, and subsequently the Space Ages, precious metals still retain their monetary role.
681코0=Water
5392코0=Water <image UI/Icons/Sections/Water_1.tga> on Mars can processed with <em>Moisture Vaporitors</em> or harvested from subsurface permafrost deposits via <em>Water Extractors</em>. It is distributed via a pipe network, which it shares with the distribution of <em>Oxygen</em>.@n@nApart from being essential for supporting life inside Domes and field buildings that have human operators, water is used for the synthesizing process of polymers and rocket fuel.@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nThe most important ingredient for life as we know it to exist is by no means scarce on Mars. However, it is mostly frozen and underground, making it difficult for acquiring. As bringing the water needed to sustain a city on Mars back from Earth will be a huge burden on every craft and far from efficient, constructing a steady water supply solely by harnessing water ice found on Mars is absolutely essential for the survival of any colony. 
5393코0=Vehicles
5394코0=VEHICLES
5395코0=Conditions on Mars are utterly hostile for humans to roam and work freely outside of <em>Domes</em>. This is why heavy-duty vehicles have been designed to tackle the tasks that humans can't.@n@nVehicles are either remote-controlled <em>Rovers</em> or semi-autonomous <em>Drones</em> and <em>Shuttles</em>.
5396코0=Rockets are used to deliver supplies all the way from Earth, or bring colonists which have applied for a life on Mars.@n@nThey are re-usable, and once having refueled on Mars, can bring Rare Metals back to Earth for monetary gains.@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nSpace rockets have far a greater role to play in the mission of establishing a permanent colony on Mars, than merely bringing the first colonists there. Until the colony can truly sustain itself, it will always be dependent on Earth for vital resources and the flow of colonists.@n@nAlthough quite expensive, re-usable rocket technology has already been mastered to a degree that can have a rocket back in space within the same day of landing on either world. 
1681코0=Drone
5397코0=Drones are the backbone of the Martian colony’s work force. They are tasked with distributing resources, gathering resources from surface deposits, building and maintaining structures as well as repairing damaged structures and vehicles. @n@nAlthough mostly autonomous, drones operate within the service range of whatever control hub they are assigned to, such as <em>Drone Hubs</em>, <em>Rockets</em> or <em>RC Rovers</em>.@n@nDrones run on batteries and need to charge up frequently. They may do so only at <em>RC Rover</em> and <em>Charging Stations</em> which in turn can be built individually or are found attached to <em>Drone Hubs</em>.@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nAll the heavy lifting and most of the field tasks are left to Drones. Drones are powerful, semi-autonomous utility vehicles which are equipped with state of the art instruments – fit for a wide range of manual labor.@n@nBuilt to be resilient against most of what the Martian environment can throw at them, the arch-enemy of all man-made technology on Mars, dust, will eventually incapacitate drones if not cleaned regularly.
1682코0=RC Rover
5398코0=RC Rovers are remote-controlled vehicles which can transport and deploy <em>Drones</em> to remote areas if needed. They can also repair any damage that the Drones have sustained.@n@nRovers are battery-powered and can recharge their batteries at any point along a power cable.@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nThe apex of human transport technology, Rovers have extended battery lives and are incredibly durable, making them resistant to most of the Martian calamities such as cold or dust. They may traverse the Colony site and reach distant spots, limited only by the topography, to tackle whatever they have been tasked with.
5399코0=RC Transports are remote controlled vehicles which are tasked with the transportation of cargo, mostly from or to places outside of drone operating ranges. Furthermore, RC Transports may set up permanent transport routes, maintaining the flow of specific or non-specified resources from one place to the other.@n@nTransport rovers can also extract resource from surface deposit (<em>Metals</em> and <em>Polymers</em>) allowing extraction and transportation of far away deposit sites.@n@nTransports are battery powered and can recharge their batteries at any point along a power cable.@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nThe apex of human transport technology, rovers have extended battery lives and are incredibly durable, resistant to most of the Martian calamities - such as cold or dust. They may traverse the colony site and reach distant spots, limited only by the topography, to tackle whatever they have been tasked with.
5400코0=RC Explorers carry with them advanced examination and research apparatus, making them the perfect vehicle to analyze any anomalous reading from anywhere in the region. As all Rovers, they are remotely controlled and can reach far-out locations if the terrain permits it.  @n@nExplorers are battery powered and can recharge their batteries at any point along a power cable.@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nThe apex of human transport technology, Rovers have extended battery lives and are incredibly durable, making them resistant to most of the Martian calamities such as cold or dust.

91코0=Shuttle
5401코0=Shuttles are a safe and rapid transportation method for Colonists between distant <em>Domes</em> and can also deliver resources reliably wherever needed – distance being irrelevant. When not in use, they are stationed at <em>Shuttle Hubs</em>, where they are maintained and refueled.@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nShuttles are optimized to traverse the low-density and low-pressure atmosphere of Mars. Their groundbreaking drives can take off vertically from anywhere, without the need of a runway or a landing platform of any sort.
4248코0=Hints
5402코0=HINTS
5403코0=Hints explain the basic mechanics of the game and will appear contextually as you play. All hints are also available in this Encyclopedia section.@n@nHints can be turned on or off from the <em>Gameplay</em> menu in <em>Options</em>
5404코0=Game Mechanics
5405코0=GAME MECHANICS
5406코0=The core mechanics of <em>Surviving Mars</em> explained.
5407코0=Dust and Maintenance
5408코0=All buildings deteriorate over time. When a building's maintenance bar is filled a drone is dispatched to bring the required maintenance resource and service the building. If the resource is not supplied within a Sol the building will stop operating until the maintenance resource is delivered and the building serviced.@n@nMartian dust and disasters contribute to the deterioration of buildings outside of Domes.@n@nExtractors, Martian dust geysers, rocket landings and launches spread dust in the area around them causing increased maintenance to nearby buildings.@n@n<em>Drones</em> are also susceptible to dust which may result in a breakdown. <em>Recharge Stations</em> clean drones during the charging process.
5409코0=Resources and Construction
5410코0=Construction of <em>Buildings</em> is the main use of resources on Mars. If a new construction site is placed within the <em>Service Range</em> of a <em>Drone</em> control point (<em>Drone Hub, RC Rover, or Rocket</em>), the Drones assigned to that hub will begin stockpiling the resources needed for construction.@n@nIMPORTANT: Said resources also need to be within the Drone’s Service Range, either in <em>Storages</em> or in raw, <em>surface deposit</em> form.@n@nResources are either gathered from deposits or are produced in <em>Extractors</em>, <em>Factories</em> or <em>Farms</em>.@n@nDeposits may be surface (<em>Metal</em> and <em>Polymers</em>), underground (<em>Metal </em>, <em>Rare Metals</em>, and <em>Water</em>) or terrain (<em>Concrete</em>).@n@nSurface deposits are mined directly by Drones, while underground and terrain deposits require <em>Extractors</em> to be built above them. Resources are stockpiled in Extractors until Drones come to take the extracted resources away where they’re needed or move them to a Depot. @n@nExtractors also generate <em>Waste Rock</em> and have limited space to store it. If said facilities are full, the Extractor will stop working until Drones move the Waste Rock to a <em>Waste Rock Dump</em>.@n@nLate game deep scanning can reveal deep underground Metals, Rare Metals and Water deposits which require specific techs before they can be extracted.
3984코0=Anomalies
8116코0=Anomalies appear all over the map in scanned sectors. Sending a RC Explorer to analyze them will trigger their effects. An anomaly can be one of the following sorts:@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@nEvent Anomaly <image UI/Icons/Anomaly_Event.tga> – These anomalies trigger events, which can be associated with Mysteries or not. @n@nResearch Anomaly<image UI/Icons/Anomaly_Research.tga>  – These anomalies instantly generate Research Points, which then contribute to any ongoing research.@n@nBreakthrough Anomaly <image UI/Icons/Anomaly_Breakthrough.tga>  – These anomalies reveal a tech on the Breakthrough tree in the Research Screen.@n@nTech Anomaly <image UI/Icons/Anomaly_Tech.tga>  – These anomalies enable specific techs to be researched, no matter their place on the tech tree. @n
5411코0=Power Distribution
5412코0=Power is distributed along power cables from <em>Power Production</em> buildings (or <em>Power Accumulators</em>) to all buildings connected to the same grid. @n@n<em>Power Switches</em> can be constructed along cables, allowing us to connect or disconnect entire sectors of the grid at will. @n@nPower cables can sustain <em>Cable Faults</em> (either from <em>Meteors</em> or just because of general erosion) and will need repair every now and then by <em>Drones</em> – provided there are Drones within reach.@n@nCable Faults drain power from the grid. Repairing them requires Metals and may take some time@n@nIMPORTANT: Denser power grids develop more Cable Faults.
5413코0=Colonists need Life Support resources in order to survive in the short term. These are <em>Water</em>, <em>Oxygen</em> and <em>Food</em>. Without access to any of these, a <em>Dome</em> will die out, with a shortage of Oxygen being the deadliest.@n@nBoth Oxygen and Water are supplied to Domes via a <em>Pipe Network</em> which must be connected to Oxygen and Water production buildings to ensure the possibility of using Water and Oxygen <em>Tanks</em> to manage temporary shortages.@n@nPipes are built by <em>Drones</em> and deteriorate over time, resulting in <em>Pipe Leaks</em> which drain Water and Oxygen from the system. Drones repair Pipe Leaks at the cost of Metals.@n@nIf a Dome is left without power it won't provide heating to Colonists and they may die due to exposure to the intense cold of the Red Planet.@n@nFood, which can initially be brought from Earth via <em>Rockets</em>, can be grown later on using <em>Farms, Hydroponic Farms</em>, and <em>Fungal Farms</em>. In contrast to Water and Oxygen, Food is not a grid resource and needs to be transported with Drones.
311코0=Research
5414코0=New technologies will unlock new <em> buildings, upgrades,</em> colonist <em>perks</em> and other benefits for the colony. Standard technologies are divided in five fields with different themes. Researching any technology will make a new technology within its field available for research. Some technologies have fixed positions in their fields, others have randomized positions.@nIndividual technologies are researched by generating research points equal to their costs. The <em>mission sponsor</em> may provide a fixed amount of research point per Sol, but research buildings will be needed to discover the later, more advanced, technologies in a timely manner. Outsourcing research is another option granting a fixed amount of research for a certain period in exchange for <em>Funding</em>.@n@nAnalyzing <em>anomalies</em> with an <em>Explorer</em> vehicle may grant research points or make new technologies available for research.@n@n<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>@n@n<em>Breakthroughs</em> are extraordinary technologies with powerful effects that are discovered only by special means. One way to unlock a breakthrough technology is to discover it in an anomaly on the surface of Mars. Different breakthrough technologies may appear in each playthrough.
5415코0=Founders
5416코0=The Founders are the first human pioneers of the red frontier and the first residents of the fledgling Colony. Their initial task is to prove the potential of the Colony and the viability of a permanent settlement on Mars.@n@nAfter the Founders arrive on the planet, the Colony will be under evaluation for a certain number of <em>Sols</em>. No new Colonists will be available until the Colony is evaluated positively. A positive evaluation will be awarded if any Founders survive a certain number of Sols, or if the first child is born on the Red Planet.@n@nSince the Founders number is limited to the capacity of the rocket, you may wish to handpick them using the <em>Review</em> command on the passenger rocket screen. Take care to micromanage their priorities during their first days on the Red Planet, using building priority and work slot management to guarantee that the crucial buildings are staffed.
5417코0=Every Colonist is a unique individual defined by his or her name, age category, workplace specialization, traits, and stats.@n@nColonists will automatically staff Residences within their Dome. Take care to provide enough living space for all of them.@n@nChildren and senior Colonists cannot work, but still require sustenance and residential space. The rest of the Colonists will seek jobs in and around their <em>Domes</em>, according to the building priority and their individual work specialization. <em>Buildings</em> with higher priority will be staffed first.@n@nSpecialized colonists will prefer to work in buildings corresponding to their individual specializations and will have better performance at such workplaces.@n@n<em>Traits</em> define details about the individual Colonists. Traits that provide beneficial effects are called <em>Perks</em>, traits with negative effects are called <em>Flaws</em>. <em>Quirks</em> are neither positive nor negative. <em>Rare</em> traits define truly exceptional individuals.@n@nEvery Colonist has four stats defining his or her current condition. <em>Health</em> represents physical fitness. <em>Sanity</em> represents mental wellbeing. <em>Comfort</em> represents the quality of the Colonist’s life on Mars. <em>Morale</em> represents happiness, optimism and loyalty. For details about individual stats and a more comprehensive description of their effects, refer to the Colonist’s <em>Infopanel</em>.@n@nBe careful - if all Colonists die, the Mars colonization mission will be terminated.
5418코0=Colonists - Moving Between Domes
5419코0=Colonists may migrate to new Domes within walking distance of their current position, or farther away when Shuttle transport becomes available.@n@nHomeless Colonists will travel to another accessible Dome with available residential space.@n@nEach <em>Dome</em> can be set up to filter Colonists by age, specialization and other traits. Colonists with ANY of the desired traits and NONE of the undesired ones will remain in the Dome, while others will seek another Dome with available living space and filter that matches their traits.
8117코0=Colonists - Managing Specializations and Traits
8118코0=Colonists with no specialization may be educated to receive a specialization in the Martian University. The University can provide needed specializations automatically or focus on a single desired specialization.@n@nSome, but not all, undesirable Flaws may be cured in the Sanatorium spire. Up to three different flaws can be treated in a single Sanatorium.@n@nThe School building cultivates desired Perks in children living in the Colony. They have a chance to receive any of the three selected Perks when they grow up. Not all Perks can be trained in School. The Playground building cultivates random Perks in children who visited it.@n@nThe University, Sanatorium and School buildings are treated as workplaces - colonists being educated or treated there cannot work a job at the same time. The individual performance of the colonists determines how fast they receive a specialization, cure a flaw or their chance to cultivate a Perk from School. The Playground service building grants its effect to any children who visit it at least once during their childhood.
5420코0=Rover and Drone Control
5421코0=All Rovers are manually controlled via the commands available in their <em>Infopanels</em>. They can either be given orders to go to a map location or to interact with a contextually specific map object – such as <em>Anomalies</em> or <em>Surface Deposits</em>.@n@n<em>Drones</em> are semi-autonomous and will queue up tasks that are flagged only if these tasks are within the <em>Service Area</em> set for each drone. However, the player can take direct control of a Drone if needed.@n<cut_if_not_platform('desktop')>@nChange your preferred controls and mappings using the Options menu.
5423코0=The map is divided in <em>Sectors</em> which need to be scanned to reveal what resources and Anomalies they hold – if any. @n@nSectors can be queued for scanning from the <em>Map Overview</em>. Sensor towers drastically increase the scanning speed of sectors near them and provide a smaller overall bonus to sector scanning.@n@nA fast and expensive way to explore the map is to buy <em>Orbital Probes</em> from Earth which instantly scans a chosen sector. @n@nBuilding in unexplored Sectors carries the risk of building directly on top of undiscovered <em>resource deposits</em>.
88코0=Wonders

5503코0=Refueling the Rocket
5504코0=Rockets require fuel to return to Earth. Fuel is produced in a <em>Fuel Refinery</em> building that can be constructed from a prefab or researched. Fuel production requires Power and Water.
172코0=Priority
5556코0=Priority is set from the Infopanel of individual buildings and constructions. Drones will try to complete higher priority tasks before lower priority ones. Buildings with higher priority will receive resources and Power in case of shortages.
4806코0=Water Production
5557코0=Water can be produced by <em>Water Extractors</em> or <em>Moisture Vaporators</em>. Water Extractors require Water deposits, while Vaporator prefabs must be brought from Earth with resupply ships. Also consider setting up a <em>Water Tower</em> as an emergency storage. <em>Pipes</em> are used to connect all life support buildings.
5558코0=Air Production
5559코0=Oxygen can be extracted from the atmosphere by a <em>MOXIE</em>. Since it is crucial for the survival of your future Colonists, an <em>Oxygen Tank</em> for storage is highly recommended. <em>Pipes</em> are used to connect all life support buildings.
5560코0=Too Early to Place a Dome
5561코0=It might be a good idea to secure some Oxygen and Water supply before building your first Dome. You may cancel construction orders at any time before the building is ready.
83코0=Domes
5562코0=<em>Domes</em> are habitable mega-structures in which the future Colonists on Mars will live. Their construction will take significant time and resources. Plan carefully when placing your first Dome – it has to be connected to a Water and Oxygen supply and Colonists from it will be able to work in the immediate area around it.
81코0=Life Support
5563코0=<em>Domes</em> have to be connected to working supply of Oxygen and Water with Pipes. <em>Colonists</em> will not be able to survive within the Dome if life support is not secured, so storage for Water and Oxygen is also recommended.
5564코0=Suggested Building: Living Quarters
5565코0=<em>Colonists</em> live in residential buildings within the <em>Domes</em>. The basic residential building is called <em>Living Quarters</em>.
5566코0=Passenger Rockets
5567코0=When you are ready you can invite the first Colonists to Mars. Launch a <em>Passenger Rocket</em> from Earth and land it near one of your Domes. The Rocket will carry some Food supplies, but you will have to secure Power, Oxygen, Water and living space in advance.
5568코0=Stats
5569코0=<em>Colonists</em> have several basic stats. You can monitor the condition of each Colonist in their Infopanel. To maintain your Colonist’s good health, you need to provide them with Water, Oxygen, Food and access to operational Service Buildings.

1116코0=Passenger Rocket
7436코0=The passenger rocket will deliver Colonists and a minimal food supply to Mars. Use <em>Review</em> to inspect the traits of the arrivals.
5574코0=Suggested Building: Hydroponic Farm
5575코0=Local Food production will be crucial to the survival of your Colonists. Consider constructing a <em>Hydroponic Farm</em>.@nKeep in mind that the initial Food production may not be sufficient for the Colony, so you may have to rely on <em>Ressuply Rockets carrying Food</em> from Earth.
5576코0=Comfort Stat and Services
5577코0=Colonists will visit buildings to increase their Comfort stat, according to their interests. They may become Earthsick and will want to leave the Colony if their Comfort becomes too low. Service Buildings are essential for the Colonists' Comfort.@n@nSuggested Building: <em>Diner</em>
87코0=Decorations
5578코0=Gardens, parks and other decorations can be visited by Colonists and require no workforce.@n@nSuggested Building: <em>Garden</em>
5579코0=Healthcare
5580코0=Healthcare Buildings will increase the Health and Sanity of the Colonists as long as they are not Starving, Thirsty, Freezing or Suffocating.@n@nSuggested Building: <em>Infirmary</em>
7027코0=Vehicle Batteries
7028코0=RC Transports are powered by batteries with limited capacity. To recharge them you have connect the vehicle to a Power grid or transfer Power from another vehicle with a charged battery.
7029코0=Earthsick Colonists
7030코0=Colonists with very low Comfort will get <em>Earthsick</em>. They will stop working and travel back to Earth at first opportunity. To prevent this, make sure they have access to a variety of operational service Buildings that satisfy their different interests.
7031코0=Renegades
7032코0=If the Morale in a Dome is too low, <em>Renegades</em> will appear. Renegades have reduced work Performance and will cause trouble. <em>Security Stations</em> can suppress them for a while, but to solve the problem you have to take steps to increase Morale.

5684코0=Even the tiniest, simply-looking rock can contain the answers to mysteries which perplexed the human mind for generations. Sometimes it takes just a simple discovery to assure us of the vastness of the Universe, an encouragement to make us look beyond the boundaries of our existence and into the future.@n@n<effect> The following Techs have been revealed on the Research screen:@n<list_text>
5685코0=Open Research Screen
7788코0=A Mission In Jeopardy
8124코0=The recent Colonist deaths are a worrisome trend which cannot be ignored!
7789코0=While the Applicants who came to Mars were aware of the many risks that would await them, the near-criminal neglect from our side is something different. We cannot keep this information from the public – and opinions are swaying in the direction that our Colony is a “death trap”.@n@nThis troublesome rumor deters many valuable candidates from coming to the new frontier – and these are people we desperately need to fulfill the great mission of colonizing Mars and bringing our vision of the future closer.@n@n<hint> Each time a Colonist dies from a non-natural death, <ApplicantsLostOnColonistDeath> Applicants leave the pool.
8125코0=Scientists and visionaries have promoted the idea of “Humanity as a multi-planetary species” as the only way to prevent a possible mass extinction.
7736코0=The dwindling resources on our planet, overpopulation and environmental crisis, as well as the risk of a global-scale Armageddon create a powerful argument for anyone doubting the importance of our mission.@n@nIt is a well understood fact that it’s a matter of “when” not “if” for a major extinction event to happen. Having a self-sustaining population on a world other than Earth when the time comes should drastically increase humankind’s odds of survival.@n@n<goal><objective>
8126코0=We have to admit that we failed to accomplish one of the main goals set before our mission. Sadly, we underestimated the difficulties of sustaining a large population on the Red Planet.
7738코0=But this failure shouldn't throw us into despair. We still have to strive to create a stable, self-sustaining foothold from which humanity would reach the stars and conquer them.@n@n<effect>Mission Evaluation objective failed - you have <count> Colonists out of <target> present on the planet.

7740코0=We managed not only to achieve our goals, but also to surpass all expectations as the size of our current Colony is far beyond the initial estimations. This day will be marked in human history by the importance of our accomplishment – we secured the future of humankind as interplanetary species.

8129코0=Our civilization, in all its glory, still bears the mark of obsolete cultural and ideological beliefs, from times when people didn't know any better. If we remain ignorant of our own flaws we risk destroying the future for our children.
7742코0=New horizons open new possibilities. Mars can be viewed as a blank canvas – a hostile, uncultivated place where humanity can start anew. A fresh start needs new people – people born on Mars, raised in a society where people cooperate and fight the odds instead of each other.@n@n<goal><objective>
8130코0=The Mission Evaluation period is over and the progress we've made was marked as... sub-optimal, to say the least.
7743코0=Martian birthrate trends are still susceptible to malicious undercurrents and the Colony depends largely on the arrival of Applicants from Earth.@n@nThe Sponsors are disappointed that their program goal - a new human civilization on Mars - can't be achieved yet. Probably it was too early to expect that humanity can beat the odds of survival on such a hostile world and reach the level of everyday comfort required to start thinking about children and the future. The burden to disprove the evil tongues who would say this is impossible now lies on our shoulders.

5686코0=Spheres: The Trusty Screwdriver
7074코0=Our attempts to penetrate the outer layer of the Sphere were unsuccessful, though they did yield some interesting results.
5687코0=Whatever lies within the Sphere is pretty capable of harnessing any energy projected at it. Furthermore, the energy used by our instruments seems to have furthered its power-up process.@n@n<effect>The Sphere charges a bit
5688코0=That is most worrying
5689코0=Spheres: Metallic Silence
7075코0=Our test results tell us the Sphere accumulates energy by absorbing radio waves,
5690코0=So thorough is the absorption process that we fail to detect even the slightest reflected wave being thrown back at us. Aside from that the Sphere remains, unsurprisingly, quiet.@n@n<effect>The Sphere charges a bit
5691코0=I kinda hope it stays quiet
5692코0=Spheres: Is it Alive?
7076코0=Our running hypothesis seems to be correct. It’s releasing energy to charge faster. Maybe it’s alive?
5693코0=While energy direction by itself is not something so unusual, utilizing it for a purpose implies intent or at least programming of some kind. Our current test-grade proof will most certainly help encourage our scientists currently tackling this mystery.@n @n<effect>The Sphere charges a bit
5694코0=Whose idea was this anyway?
5695코0=Spheres: A Buried Secret
7077코0=A short dig following an off-the-charts reading revealed a metallic spheroid buried just beneath the surface.
5696코0=Its surface is perfectly smooth and also seems to sport mirror-like features.@n@nThe way this sphere reflects its surroundings has struck our team as being especially odd. It reflects not what one would expect, and in some instances seems to entirely ignore the observer from the reflection.   @n@nThis has the potential to be something monumental. Further excavation is most definitely encouraged by everyone here at Mission Control.@n@n<effect> A half-buried sphere is revealed
5697코0=Keep me up to speed on any finds.
5698코0=Spheres: System Shock
7078코0=We tried interacting with it, which triggered some sort of response. The Sphere isn’t dormant anymore.
5699코0=Our most sensitive instruments detect a very weak, yet constant low frequency vibration, giving the Sphere a sort of hum. At least no harmful particles are detected. @n@nWe will be waiting for further test results.@n@n<effect>The Sphere begins charging.
5700코0=That’s some B-movie material right there.
5701코0=Spheres: Hello, Goodbye
7079코0=Definitive contact with an extraterrestrial being, for the first time in the history of mankind.
5702코0=Mission Control was struck speechless as the half excavated Sphere finished the job itself and un-burrowed fully on its own, then began moving - levitating with the aid of some propulsion method unknown to us. @n@nAround it, temperatures fell drastically, creating a cold area that moved around with it. Mission Control is scrambling to predict where it’s headed to and if this cold zone is a byproduct of its propulsion method. Or more like its function. @n@nThese are exciting times – scary, but exciting.@n@n<effect>The Sphere begins moving.
5703코0=The Sphere should be watched closely at all times!
5704코0=Spheres: The Sphere is a Sucker!
7080코0=It seems to be absorbing any sort of electrical current in close proximity. In other words, it’s feeding on our batteries.
5705코0=While we aren’t sure if the Sphere has any set destination it is hovering towards, we have enough evidence to say that a new process has been initiated by the Sphere. For what purpose, we cannot say as of now.@n@n<hint> The Sphere drains batteries and charges quicker.
5706코0=Son of a…
5707코0=Spheres: Bad Vibrations
7081코0=The humming’s less than subtle now, with the added bonus that it’s clearly harming any Colonists that come too close.
5708코0=While it does not seem to be lethal in any moderate doses, any Colonist, subject to the Sphere’s influence, shows signs of deteriorating health and needs a solid few days at the Infirmary.@n@nOur researchers have several theories on what this phenomenon is and should we prioritize it, we may be able to come up with a way to protect our citizens from the harmful influence of any such Sphere. @n@n<effect> <em>Sphere Protection</em> research available.
5709코0=The safety of our citizens is always a priority!
5710코0=A Eulogy for an Everyday Hero
7082코0=We gather here today to bid a final farewell to one of our finest.
5711코0=As difficult and painful as it is, we must accept that <ColonistName(colonist)> is dead. As friends, as a community, we express our sadness, we acknowledge our loss, acknowledge the great importance of <ColonistName(colonist)>’s life.@n@n<ColonistName(colonist)>’s life has been a journey towards a vision, a journey which brought us all towards the possibility of living on the Red Planet, one small step after at a time. <ColonistName(colonist)> didn’t try to make their mark in human history, for there is no room for attempts in success. <ColonistName(colonist)> knew what the calling of fate was, knew the risks and the opportunities and made the best of it, for the good of us all.@n@nWhat is it that takes a person through all of this is a question only we can answer. This is a question whose answer is the spirit of <ColonistName(colonist)>, and this is a legacy for us.@n@n<effect><ColonistName(colonist)> has died.

5712코0=Thank you, fellow Colonists.
5713코0=Mental Breakdown
7083코0=A Colonist just snapped!
5714코0=<ColonistName(colonist)>, as every other Colonist, went through psychological conditioning before arriving on Mars to guarantee their most basic ability to cope with the adverse environment. Indeed, the people live on a barren, dead-cold world with a toxic, almost non-existent atmosphere, protected only by a fragile-looking Dome and relying on machines to keep them alive.@n@nThe unparalleled everyday stress levels slowly drain the people of their resolve – thus even the slightest shock or frustration can send someone over the edge. On Earth entertainment and recreation are just for fun, but here they are a tool for basic survival.@n@n<hint> The Colonist <ColonistName(colonist)> has reached critically low Sanity. Provide operational Healthcare buildings in the Domes and avoid Heavy workload or Nighttime work to prevent this situation.
5716코0=Suffocation!
7084코0=Our Colonists are suffocating! We only have a few hours to get them more Oxygen before they run out!
5717코0=Our Domes are large enough to contain tons of breathable air, but when the systems fail to refresh the supply, the amount of carbon dioxide will steadily increase until the atmosphere becomes unbreathable.@n@n<hint> Colonists with the Suffocating status effect have no access to Oxygen and will die within a short time. Connect their Dome to operational MOXIEs and Oxygen Tanks or plant Oxygen-Producing Crops in Farms to supply them with Oxygen.
5718코0=Dehydration!
7085코0=The Colonists are on the brink of dehydration! We need to figure out something quick before they die.
5719코0=Water is the vital fluid which sustains all life. The human body requires a constant access to fresh, drinkable water and quickly deteriorates when none is present. Thus the extraction of Water is one of our utmost priorities.@n@n<hint> Colonists with the Dehydrated status effect have no access to Water and will die within a short time. Connect their Dome to operational Water Producers or filled Water Towers to supply them with Water.
5720코0=Oh my!
5721코0=Hypothermia!
7086코0=Our Colonists are suffering from hypothermia!
5722코0=Domes feature heaters which maintain a pleasant temperature of 23 degrees Celsius around the clock, protecting against the fluctuating temperature of the fickle Martian atmosphere outside. The temperature inside the Dome quickly decreases when the power supply is cut and the Colonists sure do feel the effects. If the situation remains unchanged, I'm afraid that it could be fatal.@n@n<hint> Colonists with the Freezing status effect reside in a Dome with an insufficient supply of Power. Increase the amount of Power accessible to the Dome to prevent this.
5723코0=Starvation!
7087코0=Our Colonists are starving!
5724코0=Constant supply of fresh nutrients is vital to the survival of the Colony. The Colonists can go on for some time before they suffer more adverse effects from the lack of food, but if you don't feed them soon, they will die.@n@n<hint> Colonists with the Starving status effect have no access to Food. Deliver Food from Earth or produce it by farming to supply the starving.
5715코0=Troubling.
7088코0=The day claimed our last living Founder, spelling the end of an era for us all.
5726코0=<ColonistName(colonist)> had a dream – to see humanity united, conquering the stars. And <ColonistName(colonist)> allowed nothing to stand in the path of this dream. No hardship, no loss, not even personal safety. What more can anyone be asked to do?@n@nWe had known many women and men of character, of strength and virtue. Any one of them might have stepped into <ColonistName(colonist)>'s place and we would be none the wiser. But we know why <ColonistName(colonist)> chose this path. When a heart as big and strong beats in one's chest it gives no other option but to follow its call.@n@nWhen <ColonistName(colonist)> fell, it left a void. Do not let it take over your hearts, friends. Do not mourn the icon of good that we have lost, rather rise up and become the icon yourself. Let this death be not a blow against the will of humanity to grow, learn and conquer new frontiers.@n@n<hint>The Founder <ColonistName(colonist)> died. Cause: <reason>.
5728코0=Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night
7089코0=Today was a tough one. We lost one of our Founders.
5729코0=We will all have our own special memories of the mark <ColonistName(colonist)> left in our hearts and in our lives. I am certain that <ColonistName(colonist)> would have wanted us all to be here today filled not with grief but with strength, vision and hope for the future. This is what <ColonistName(colonist)> lived for and doing otherwise would make this cause pointless.@n@nWe are all here today not only because <ColonistName(colonist)> laid down the foundations of our Colony. We were all personally touched and inspired by their strong character, personality and presence. We were all very lucky to have had <ColonistName(colonist)> beside us in both good and bad moments and, as much as will be missing our comrade, their memory will live on as long as we remain united.@n@n<hint>The Founder <ColonistName(colonist)> passed away due to old age.
5727코0=Rest in peace, friend.
7090코0=Nobody Knows The Trouble I've Seen...
7092코0=It's a rough life here on Mars. You can't prepare for addiction.
7091코0=Despite the great lengths we go through to make it seem safe and as close as possible to home, one’s mind is never too far from the dangers that the privilege of being an interplanetary pioneer carries. We all find our own ways to cope with this pressure.  <ColonistName(colonist)> finds it in the bottle.@n@n<hint>The Founder <ColonistName(colonist)> has the <em>Alcoholic</em> Trait.
7093코0=Alcohol is not the answer.
7442코0=In Space, No One Can Hear you Whine
7444코0=The Founders are supposed to be the pillars of the future Colony – destined to be remembered for generations.
7443코0=For they are meant to tread and live where no man has ever lived before – in an environment not meant for man to live in to begin with. This is why it came as a shock to us all when <ColonistName(colonist)> turned out to be such a whiner!@n@n<hint>The Founder <ColonistName(colonist)> has the <em>Whiner</em> Trait. 
7445코0=Oh boy...
7094코0=Courage Has Layers
7096코0=It takes more than bravery to be a pioneer of the Martian frontier. Or at least it should.
7095코0=They face uncertainty which no humans have faced before. <ColonistName(colonist)> on the other hand, albeit a pioneer, doesn’t seem especially brave and makes jumping in fright after seeing one’s own shadow look like a normal thing. @n@n<hint>The Founder <ColonistName(colonist)> has the <em>Coward</em> Trait.
7097코0=Courage is finite.
5518코0=Suggested Building: Concrete Extractor
7937코0=Many of the colony buildings require Concrete for their construction. Due to the heavy weight of the material continuous imports from Earth are not practical in the long run and we have to secure its production in the colony.@n@nConcrete extractors must be placed over sulfur-rich regolith deposits - the yellow patches found often on the Martian surface. Like many other colony buildings, concrete extractors will require Power and regular maintenance from Drones.
7098코0=When Life Gives You Lemons...
7100코0=Building a new home on an alien world? That takes guts, to say the least.
7099코0=After all, purpose is the strongest long-term driver. Since arriving on Mars, <ColonistName(colonist)>'s enthusiasm has proven to be above average, even by Founder norms, and the prodigious productivity displayed can be boiled down to one simple explanation – <ColonistName(colonist)> really loves doing what <ColonistName(colonist)>‘s doing.@n@n<hint>The Founder <ColonistName(colonist)> has the <em>Enthusiast</em> trait.
7101코0=That's the spirit!
7102코0=Gambling Midst The Stars 
7104코0=The first Colonists are all gamblers coming to Mars. It's the ultimate roll of the dice.
7103코0=They travel through 50 million miles to a rocky, inhospitable world and try to bend it to humanity's will. <ColonistName(colonist)> , on the other hand, seems to also be a gambler in the more traditional sense. @n@nWe must not judge. On the contrary, we must be supportive and help our dear comrade with whom we’ve traversed the void, spearheaded humanity’s expansion on other worlds, only to find that we are no safer from vices so Earthly, it’s as if we never left.@n@n<hint>The Founder <ColonistName(colonist)> has the <em>Gambler</em> trait.
7446코0=OK
7105코0=Call It What You Will
7107코0=Living in cramped quarters, tinkering with intricate machinery day-in, day-out. There's plenty of opportunities for slip-ups.
7106코0=Warning signs and instructions are, usually, enough to prevent most of them being done by most people. <ColonistName(colonist)> is not like most people and instructions and warnings seem to be of little to no use. @n@nWe, as a small community, have come to accept the obvious: @n@n<hint>The Founder <ColonistName(colonist)> has the <em>Idiot</em> trait.
7447코0=OK
5725코0=End of an Age
7108코0=Mars has ways of crushing the hope out of our very best.
5730코0=The Founders had always been more than explorers and pioneers. They shared a vision of the future of the civilization on the Red Planet and worked ceaselessly towards their common goal.@n@nBut, as it often happens during the course of history the, societal standpoint changes. <ColonistName(colonist)> could not adapt to the changing times and decided to leave Mars. I know <ColonistName(colonist)> personally and I'm sure that this isn't caused by disappointment but instead is a rational decision. I remember one time when we talked about the future of the Colony and <ColonistName(colonist)>'s words: “We are the progenitors of the Colony but parents have to eventually step down and give way to their children.”@n@nAs I watch the rocket fly towards Earth I cannot force myself to think that <ColonistName(colonist)> is abandoning us. Something tells me that we will be in contact and will continue to receive wise council from our last Founder.@n@n<hint>The last Founder <ColonistName(colonist)> has left Mars.
7987코0=View.
5731코0=Farewell, friend.
5732코0=Spheres: More to Come
7109코0=The Mirror Sphere has Mission Control in total chaos. Though that’s expected given what we saw.
5733코0=In a moment of pure awesomeness the Sphere split into two identical Spheres. The new objects have grown to the exact same size as the previous one.@n@nThe second Sphere is now entirely independent from the first, moving in a direction of its own choosing, yet the two Spheres are clearly interacting with each other at a distance. Their humming frequencies are changing simultaneously and the more they resonate, the more a slight ionization of the atmosphere around them becomes evident.@n@nAt the moment of the splitting a vast amount of data was gathered by our instruments, so we may have the means to dig deeper within this mystery. Until then we can only predict that some event will trigger when a certain resonance frequency has been reached by both Spheres.@n@n<effect>The Sphere divided into two separate Spheres.
5734코0=Well, this can’t be good...
5735코0=Spheres: It Works!
7110코0=Those decoy buildings worked just like we planned, much to the dismay of our hardworking engineers. We've captured our first Sphere!
5736코0=Apart from controlling where it goes and what damage it does, this is of little use to us at the moment as we can’t dismantle them or even hinder their function in any way. @n@nHowever, this is critical for closer observation and research.@n@n<effect> A Sphere is being held motionless.
5737코0=Aced it!
5738코0=Spheres: Choose Your Poison
7111코0=Humanity applied its knowledge of an alien technology for the first time ever. And it was a complete success.
5739코0=The Sphere is converted back to its precious ingredients.@n@nOur scientists are quick to inform us that any Sphere free from our decoy buildings will roll back to its splitting phase and will most probably try to retrieve the critical amount needed for their collective purpose.@n@nWe feel we have gathered enough information from these Spheres. It’s been deemed that decomposing all the Spheres is our best road of action.@n@n<effect> A Sphere was converted into resources.
5740코0=My thoughts exactly.
5741코0=Spheres: 3 Up, More to Come
7112코0=The Spheres just keep dividing. This level of technology… We can't even begin to comprehend it.
5742코0=The new Sphere also exhibits the humming of the previous two and is also resonating with them and the atmosphere around it. We have adjusted the predicted trigger point of the unknown event, as now it is expected to come earlier due to the higher Sphere count.  @n@nThe good news is that the more there are, the more observation material is available for our scientists.@n@nWe should be able to paint a general picture of their purpose after investing some time to research them. @n@n<effect> <em>Purpose of the Spheres</em> research available.
5743코0=Can’t decide if this is good news or bad.
5744코0=Spheres: Climate Change 
5745코0=What or who needs to lower the atmospheric temperature of contemporary Mars is beyond any of us – yet it is most evident that the Spheres are effective at what they are doing. @n@nIf we want to stop the change, we must find a breakthrough based on what we already know and learn how to control or cancel this process.@n@n<effect> A prolonged, extremely strong Cold Wave has begun.@n<effect> <em>Xeno-Terraforming</em> research available.
5746코0=This is now officially a fight for survival.
5747코0=Spheres: To Future Generations
7114코0=We’ve dismantled the last Sphere, yet our unease with the alien technology still lingers.
5748코0=The Cold Wave that had gripped our Colony has finally been dispelled. Temperatures have returned to the normal, cruelly cold levels we are used to.@n@nOur scientists are confident that we have recorded and gathered all data necessary for making sense of this encounter in the coming decades. Also, they are confident that the Spheres themselves had overstayed their welcome. @n@nKeeping them around would have meant living with the ever-present danger of re-activating the endless Cold Wave once more, even if we had managed to find a way to halt it without destroying all the Spheres. @n@nAnd despite the risks, despite the purely pragmatic reasons for destroying all the Spheres, one can’t help but wonder how the generations to come will feel of this deed. Will we go down in history as cowards? Or maybe as too insensitive to the magnitude of the encounter, the very first non-man-made technology ever found?@n@nWhen our scientists give up on trying to determine the origin of these Spheres, will textbooks mention that because of the rash actions and fears of the few pioneers that lived on Mars at the time, the riddle will never be solved?@n@n<effect> No more Spheres are left.@n<effect> Cold Wave dispelled.
5749코0=The end of an era.

7124코0=Full of hope and determination, the first Founders have set foot on the Red Planet.
5752코0=The next 10 Sols will be full of difficulties and dangers, but also with great promises and opportunities. It is now to us to prove that Mars can be a doorway to greater riches and the future of the human civilization. Even the most epic adventures begin with a single step.@n@n<effect> Arrival of additional Colonists temporarily suspended until the Colony proves able to sustain human life. Your Founder Colonists must survive for 10 Sols before additional people can arrive.@n@n<hint> The Colony will be evaluated positively before the period ends in the event the first human is born on Mars. If you feel you are up to the challenge, try constructing a Medical Building and raising the Comfort of the Founders as much as possible with Service Buildings.
5753코0=First Dome Constructed!
7125코0=It's been a stellar day. Not just for the mission, but for humanity itself.
5754코0=Sol <day> of our mission will be remembered. Our greatest project to date has been completed – the Dome is ready to harbor the first Colonists on Mars. We, the team at Mission Control, are honored to be among the ones chosen to mark the beginning of a new age.@n@nWe created a place for humanity to call home, a place which reminds us of Earth. The Dome seems so fragile, like a glittering snow globe resting among the red sands. This makes us wonder – will our future be just as fragile? Would we be able to leave our cradle and thrive on this cold, distant world?
5755코0=Continue playing
7126코0=For the first time, a human has been born on Mars. It's truly a unique miracle.
5757코0=The Colonists have always felt like a family. But what makes the family stronger and more united is the promise of new life and better future. We have truly been blessed with a rewarding responsibility – to carry the torch of hope.@n@nLet this blooming of life serve as a symbol for all humans. Mars is no longer a dead world.@n@n<effect> The Colony has been evaluated positively. Additional Colonists can be called from Earth.
5756코0=The Door towards the Stars
7128코0=This will go down in history.
5758코0=The long-time dream of the human civilization as a whole – to settle another world – has come true. To be among the people who made this happen makes me feel enthusiastic and proud.@n@nWe are already swarmed with applications for relocation on Mars and the wanderlust and enthusiasm of these people makes me proud to be a human being. The Red Planet continues to be inhospitable and even dangerous but we as a species had always displayed the ability to adapt and improve – the adverse conditions will only make us try harder. So I say bring it on!@n@n<effect> The Colony has been evaluated positively. Additional Colonists can be called from Earth.

5766코0=Failure's just another step in the process. The only thing is to dust ourselves off and try again. And when the future generations return to Mars, our experience, our mistakes and achievements will help them succeed where we could not.@n@n<effect> All Founders have either died or left Mars. The Colony couldn't live up to the dream of human colonization. Game over. But don't give up!
5765코0=Game Over
8157코0=The Colony has failed. The lives and the dreams of our Colonists are lost, washed away by despair and grief.
8156코0=Now, our goal as a species is to not despair. To not look away from the stars. The path has proven to be hard and rocky, but hardship had only made humans more determined – and that’s what defines us as a species! We are sure that one day people will walk the red sands and call Mars their home.@n@n<effect> All Colonists have either died or left Mars. Game over. But don't give up!

7156코0=You’d think the Explorer had found buried treasure, the way our scientists were reacting. It was a sulfur-rich regolith!
5774코0=The Explorer vehicle gathered various soil samples from far and wide around the Anomaly site and fed us the data. For hours, the telemetry was filled with buzzing chatter as the scientists at Mission Control discussed the implications of the element and made inventive plans about the future. The time of the expedition was limited and we urged them to make a final decision.
5775코0=Concentrate effort on gathering as many samples as possible. (<research(1000)>)
5777코0=Focus on geochemical analysis of the most Sulphide-rich samples. (Engineering research boost: 10%)
7157코0=We’ve got bad news. The RC Explorer investigating the anomaly accidentally released a pocket of high-pressure gas.
5779코0=The carbon dioxide erupted, damaging the rover and lifting tons of fine dust into the atmosphere, forming a Dust Devil. The Red Planet reminded us how dangerous an alien world could be.@n@n<effect>Expect fierce Dust Devils to form at the Anomaly location.
7158코0=The readings told us it was a vein rich with ore, but the data turned out to be incorrect. Under those fine red sands lay the intact hull of a rover.
5780코0=We immediately recognized it – Curiosity. A historic finding that stretched its hand in a welcoming gesture through the years back to the first missions on the Red Planet. It belonged in a museum, but on the other hand was an opportunity to gain more parts that we could rarely get our hands on. It was a tough decision.
5781코0=Send Curiosity back to Earth. (<funding(500000000)> Funding)
5783코0=Display it as a monument in the Colony. (Social research boost: 10%)
7159코0=Our initial spectrographic analysis confirmed it. Chromium. To find such a rich deposit of such a rare metal. Important was an understatement.
5785코0=The geological team couldn't wait to get their hands on the samples, but this was going to prevent the engineering team from smelting the materials for their ceaseless operations. The experts at Mission Control argued for hours, but the course of action was clear.
5786코0=Study the Chromium deposit. (Engineering research boost: 10%)
5788코0=Exploit the deposit. (deep Rare Metals deposit)
7160코0=Someone joked we found kryptonite. It was because of the greenish-yellow hue of the beryl crystals. 
5790코0=The contrast with the red Martian dust made them appear almost alien. Even if they wouldn't make any of the Colonists superhuman, they would surely give us almost supernatural powers!@n@nOur plans at Mission Control included the introduction of a long-term nuclear energy solution for the growing Colony, and the Beryllium that we would produce from these minerals would be an immense help in this difficult mission. We would encase the nuclear fuel rods of our nuclear reactors in Beryllium and make a good use of its incredible mechanical, chemical and nuclear properties.@n@n<effect>The Technologies in the Physics tree gain a 10% Boost.
5791코0=Awesome!
7161코0=The rover manipulators held the silver-white mineral up to the camera just as the chemical analysis came through. We’ve found Tellurium.
5792코0=In a moment, the Chief Engineer at Mission Control was at the communications station, urging instructions to the RC Explorer on how to handle and analyze the discovery. It was amusing to watch the almost childlike excitement in the eyes of the expert.@n@nThis is a significant discovery because it allows us to overcome an old problem in metallurgy. Easily-machinable metals allow for economical manufacturing of components, but the factors that allow it usually lower their performance, and vice versa. Thus, engineers had always been challenged to find ways to balance the two factors. The addition of Tellurium to iron alloys allows them to perform better in both areas.@n@n<effect>The Technologies in the Robotics tree gain a 10% Boost.
5793코0=Great news!
7162코0=Get up close and personal with Mars and you’ll find it’s anything but barren. We found another treasure in the form of a small deposit of a Germanium-rich mineral.
5794코0=The purity of the Germanium found in the vein is amazing, which our scientific team presumes is due to the millennia-long loss of volatiles in the Martian atmosphere.@n@nGermanium started out as the humble ekasilicon proposed by Mendeleev and for almost a century it was discerned as a useless metal, only for late 20th century discoveries to make it one of the cornerstones of modern electronics.@n@n<effect>Discovered Rare Metals deposit.
7163코0=The probe’s drill had hit one hundred meters before it detected a spike in temperature. The data tells us it was ignited Magnesium compounds.
5795코0=We are still waiting for confirmation but the preliminary results are clear. There are signs of chemical burning, indicating a combustible material in contact with the probe. The mechanical friction of the drilling head must have ignited the magnesium. What a great discovery!@n@nScientists on Earth had long planned the creation of jet engines that could burn the carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere with the use of magnesium powder. With abundant amounts on site, the research teams could begin preliminary testing of a working prototype right away!@n@n<effect>Tech Boost (10%) for all Robotics Technologies.
7164코0=Until today, the only place we’d thought you could find Ice XV outside of a lab was on an icy planet or a moon. And here we find it. On Mars.
5796코0=Ice XV is a super-dense phase of water ice which is formed in extremely cold and extremely high-pressure environments. It turns out that the unique geological history of Mars allowed a small quantity of Ice XV to form under the crust.@n@nEven though we didn't confirm any substantial deposits of water, this discovery would cause uproar in the scientific communities and draw significant attention to our efforts on the Red Planet. Our sponsors immediately provided us with tools to discover more about the effects of Martian geology on the formation of underground ice.@n@n<effect>Gain <funding(500000000)> Funding.
7165코0=We’ve just confirmed the location of a metal-rich deposit. A drilling accident turned to our advantage.
5797코0=We lost a drilling probe while trying to analyze this Anomaly. The signal was suddenly lost and we got the tingling feeling that we would get lucky with the second one. The operators were extra careful and the second insertion revealed a vast network of underground cavities beneath the hard rock plate. On top of that, we managed to get in contact with the first probe which had fallen through in another section of the crust faults. We used the two probes as triangulation points for telemetry and pinpointed the location of the deposit.@n@n<effect>Discovered a Metal deposit.
7166코0=The on-site data validates our predictive models of the electrically-charged dust devils.
5798코0=Science is well aware of the causes of the massive Earth storms, monsoons and tornadoes and yet we never ceased to admire the primeval forces unleashed before our eyes. The same goes for Martian electrostatic dust storms. Our scientists already had a good working model on the behavior of these peculiar weather Anomalies on the Red Planet. Now we can refine this model even further. With the current expedition complete, we can confirm their theory, yet I doubt anyone would ever cease to revere the massive dust storms.@n@n<effect>Gain <research(2000)>
7167코0=The Anomaly turned out to be one of the most well-preserved asteroid impacts in our area. No geologist could ever put a price on it.
5799코0=Earth scientists had long wondered about the effect of ancient asteroid impacts on Martian climate and geology. Several missions had been sent to gather data about these primordial events but the landers failed, as if the Red Planet wanted to keep some of its secrets for itself. Generations had to pass until we managed to send a successful expedition to lift the shroud of mystery.@n@nWith the data we gathered from the site, our colleagues on Earth will have material for years of research. Maybe we would finally find out whether the Martian core was shut down or it died out on its own, and we would be able to predict the destiny of our home world.@n@n<effect>You gain <funding(800000000)> Funding@n<effect>You gain <research(3000)>
7168코0=We've just found Beagle 2. Or at least what’s left of it.
5800코0=Over the years over two-thirds of the missions sent to Mars ended in disaster. The tragic course of events, attributed to bad luck, human error, or simply to the inevitability of shooting blind in the dark, had created a dark humor revolving around the Great Galactic Ghoul which feeds on exploration probes and the mystery of the Martian Triangle.@n@nOne of the best-equipped probe missions to Mars was Beagle 2, which failed dramatically in the last minutes before landing. Failed by the parachutes and the treacherous Martian atmosphere, the brave little probe crashed at fatally high speed against the red desert.@n@n<effect> Gain Tech Boost (10%) to all Robotics Technologies.
5801코0=Begin analysis on the crash site.
7169코0=We’ve analyzed material from the Anomaly and it completely validates our hypothesis on abiogenic petroleum!
5802코0=The pocket of natural gas we discovered deep among the hydrocarbon rocks was nothing short of an evidence of petroleum formation. The geophysicists here, at Mission Control, stare at the research data in disbelief. Mars, even in its alien nature, has proven once more a teacher in the mysteries so well veiled on our home world.@n@nThis unique opportunity allows us to gaze into the past of Mars and gather knowledge which would take months to simulate inside a laboratory.
5803코0=Conduct on-site volatiles experiments. (Physics research boost: 10%)

5808코0=Uranium-Rich Hematite
7170코0=It’s not every day that we have the luxury to choose from what Mars has to offer.
5809코0=The planet constantly reminds us of its old habit – to give with one hand and take with the other. The rover came across coffinite rocks rich in uranium, clustered on top of a rich hematite deposit. The mineral veins were positioned in such a manner inside the rock that we couldn't blast through without compromising some of them.@n@nWe faced a difficult decision, but at the end, it was a matter of simple pragmatics.
5810코0=Exploit the Hematite vein. (rich Metals deposit)
5812코0=Exploit the Uranium vein. (Rare Metals deposit)
7171코0=The analysis tells us that we’ve found Iridium-rich sulfides! That’s a real rarity on Earth!
5814코0=Mankind's ingenuity had found a myriad of applications for it. But we focused our plan on a much simpler, more vital role in our growing Colony – RTGs. Free energy for everyone!@n@n<effect>Tech Boost (10%) to all Physics Technologies.
5815코0=Excellent!
7172코0=The Rover went dark for five hours. When it rebooted, it confirmed it had come into contact with an unusually high-voltage electrical charge.
5816코0=The red alert was sounded immediately after we lost contact with the RC Explorer vehicle. Five long hours of fear and desperation ended with the reinstating of data feed. A wave of relief passed through the crowd of scientists gathered at the control center. The telescopic drill used to probe the crust at the Anomaly site disturbed a layer of magnetite-rich rocks, the source of the electric charge. The rover is still functional but it would take time before its locomotion systems are fully restored. The operators turned the defeat into a victory, devoting the unexpected time window to studying the magnetic properties of the Martian crust.@n@n<effect>The RC Explorer has malfunctioned. It has to be repaired by Drones.@n<effect>Tech Boost (50%) granted to the following technologies: Low-G Drive (faster Drones and Rovers), Autonomous Sensors (Sensor Towers require no Power or Maintenance).@n<effect> Gain <funding(200000000)> Funding.
7173코0=We’ve just found the wreckage of Phobos-2! The old probe even had some new data for us to analyze.
5817코0=On July 7th, 1988 the Soviet Union launched two Proton-K rockets carrying the Phobos-1 and Phobos-2 probes on a course to Mars. Of the two craft only Phobos-2 reached its final destination, but contact with it was lost just before it could deliver its precious payload.@n@nHumankind will be forever grateful for the information we salvaged from its computers.@n@n<effect>Locations of several Anomalies discovered.@n<hint> Check the map for the new locations.
7174코0=Our Explorer just got into a pretty serious accident. The good news is it’s still in one piece.
5818코0=The vehicle stumbled upon a crust fault which could have lasted for a couple hundreds of years under the slow erosion of the planet. Disturbed by the mechanical motion of the scanning probes, the surface opened like a wound and swallowed the rover, luckily, only for a dozen of meters. The sturdy machine got out of the hole, but nevertheless it sustained heavy damage.@n@nMillions of years ago Mars had been shaken to its core by cataclysmic impact which sealed the fate of the planet. Since then Mars, like all giants, is dying, too slow for our mortal eyes to witness. Yet even today the death-throes of the Red Planet can be felt unmistakably.@n@n<effect>The RC Explorer has malfunctioned. It has to be repaired by Drones.
7175코0=We’ve found signs of native life!
5819코0=The sensor reading from the Anomaly site provided the answer to one of the biggest mysteries about Mars. The Explorer examined a mineral cluster and found the preserved remains of microscopic life forms. We've managed to confirm that the deposit originated on Mars and not on one of the many asteroids that pockmark the surface of the planet.@n@nThe team is ecstatic with the find. If there was past life on Mars, perhaps we are not alone in the universe!
5820코0=Publicize the find as a triumph of the Mars mission. (<funding(choice_param1)> Funding)
5822코0=Publicize the find as a triumph of humankind. (<choice_param2> Applicants)
7176코0=We found some useful material in the debris from a small meteorite.
5824코0=After minimal processing, the resources can be transported and put to good use for the benefit of the Colony.@n@n<effect> We discovered 30 Rare Metals at the Anomaly site.
5825코0=Every little bit helps.
7177코0=We’ve discovered a magnificent vista at the site of the anomaly.
5826코0=Even after watching the cold splendor of the Red Planet for so long, Mission Control was awestruck by the beautiful footage provided by our intrepid reconnaissance vehicle.@n@n<effect><reg_param1> new Applicants are available on Earth.
5827코0=Let's hope we never tire of this beauty!
7178코0=We’ve collected valuable geographic data at the site of the Anomaly.
5828코0=Analysis of the crust yielded rare insights on the geological history of Mars, especially about the ancient Theiikian period, in which volcanic activity released immense amounts of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere. Several key hypotheses of the exo-geologists were confirmed by our findings.@n@nThe scientific community praised the findings, raising the status of our mission in the eyes of humanity. Our sponsor committed additional funds to the mission.
5829코0=Get <funding(choice_param1)> Funding.
5831코0=Get 2 Drone Hub Prefabs.
5833코0=Get 4 Moisture Vaporator Prefabs.
7179코0=The odd composition of the debris collected from the anomaly site has proven to be an uncrackable riddle for our science team.
5835코0=The experts all agree that the materials discovered at the Anomaly site could not originate on Mars, but they are also in agreement that they are not the remains of a meteorite or a contaminant introduced from our Rockets. For now it looks like the origin of the debris will remain a mystery.@n@nAs wise men throughout history said more than once: the more we know, the more we realize that we don't know.@n@n<effect> A Genius Applicant is available on Earth.
5836코0=Nothing like a good puzzle!
7180코0=Though initially fruitless, we recalibrated the operating spectrum for our scans and voila!
5837코0=The unusual chemical composition of the regolith near the Anomaly site effectively shielded it from our data gathering. As we re-purposed and improved our scanning technology based on these new findings, we were rewarded with an unexpected surprise.@n@n<effect>Large Water deposit discovered.
7181코0=There were no secrets to find near the Anomaly site, just a scene of breathtaking beauty.
5838코0=Such photo-ops have proven to be useful for the mission, inspiring people on Earth to believe that humanity should create its new home on the Red Planet.@n@n<effect> A Celebrity Applicant is available on Earth.
7182코0=We discovered unusual crystals in the remains of a meteorite. The magnified images of their crystalline matrix were broadcast by every major news channel on Earth.
5839코0=One tabloid even claims that the crystal is in fact artificially created - some kind of artwork of a microscopic alien race.@n@n""The work resembles million tiny cylinders surrounded by flames. If you squint your eyes, the very static of the composition resembles a star map. The image is bordered by double rainbows while the work has an abstract feeling and a very dynamic structure.""@n@nWhile all this unscientific sensationalism had outraged our experts, the publicity provided us with some unexpected benefits.@n@n<effect>You gain <funding(reg_param1)>.
5840코0=I want to believe!
7183코0=The Explorer made a thorough scan of the Anomaly site but couldn't find anything unusual.
5841코0=Regrettably, it appears that the unusual readings were just a sensor glitch.
5842코0=Or were they?
5858코0=Expedition Disaster: Marooned In Space
5859코0=The RC Explorer is a robust, yet complex machine. Those unacquainted would be astonished when they see the mission reports where dozens of minor breakdowns happened during an expedition and were ignored by the operators. Expedition veterans know that a dead light bulb won't break down the vehicle and they ignore it with a wry smile.@n@nBut when something as serious as the motor system breaks down, it takes bravery not to panic. There is no time for desperation then, our drones have to repair the malfunction before it causes more harm.@n@n<effect>The RC Explorer suffered a malfunction. It has to be repaired by Drones
7184코0=As with everything made by the hands of man, the Explorer isn’t without its breakdowns and failures.
7185코0=We should research the Dark Spectrometry technology to learn more about the Black Cubes
5862코0=A peculiar black cube matrix has appeared near the Colony. We should send an Explorer to investigate.
5863코0=An unknown black, previously undetected cube-shaped object
5864코0=Mystery Cube
5865코0=Reportedly, a black cube has appeared within the extractor.
5866코0=Cube Disaster
5867코0=Power of Three: Disappearing Act
7186코0=A Concrete Extractor went abruptly silent. Maintenance requests were met with nothing but static.
5868코0=This event was unlike any malfunction predicted in the security protocols. Orbital scans on the site revealed no evidence of the existence of the huge structure – only a black cube matrix centered on the spot where the extractor was supposed to be.@n@n<effect>A Concrete Extractor has been destroyed by a Black Cube. An Anomaly has appeared on the site.
5869코0=We must investigate
5870코0=A Black Cube has led to the destruction of a Concrete Extractor. We should investigate the site with an Expedition.
5871코0=Power of Three: A Black Cube Appears
7187코0=A routine scan of the perimeter has detected an unidentified object within immediate proximity of the Colony. Data logs confirm it – it isn’t a glitch.
5872코0=The mysterious object appears to consist of pitch-black cubes arranged in a matrix. The cubes seemingly levitate above the ground without the aid of any support structure.@n@nPreliminary image analysis remains inconclusive. An on-site investigation is required to assess the Anomaly. We advise caution.@n@n<effect>A Black Cube has appeared seemingly out of nowhere. We have to investigate this Anomaly.
5873코0=A black cube? Most peculiar…
5874코0=Power of Three: ...For, They Came in Numbers
7188코0=The mysterious cubes continue to appear across the colony. Mission Control advises all personnel to remain calm and stick to protocol.
5875코0=The cube structures tend to emerge without warning, as unscientific as it may sound, out of thin air. Apart from their evident presence, so far the structures pose no threat to the Colony.@n@nUntil further investigation, the scientific board of Mission Control has decided to impose an information blackout on the matter to prevent the spread of panic and fear among the Colonists.
5876코0=There is a certain sense of urgency to this, it seems.
5877코0=More than a hundred cubes have appeared. Their purpose and origin are still unknown.
5878코0=Power of Three: Making Sense of the Unknown
7189코0=We can’t hide the truth from the public, not when the Colony’s being swarmed by black cubes.
5879코0=Without any credible explanation, the Colony was soon flooded with various rumors and interpretations of the mystery. What if they're bombs? Billions of tiny bombs? Or transport capsules maybe, with a mini robot inside. Or deadly hard drives. Or alien eggs? Or messages needing decoding. Or they're all parts of a bigger whole. Jigsaw puzzles that need to be put together.@n@nThe team at Mission Control is against trying to spread further misinformation and propaganda – partially because it would just add to the total confusion, but mainly because it would endanger the philosophical principles of our mission. We could only trust in our Colonists and hope for the best.
5880코0=We have to come up with something better.
5881코0=Power of Three: Dark Properties
7190코0=On-site analysis of the unidentified structure only deepens the mystery. The evidence suggests that the cubes are clearly not a natural phenomenon.
5882코0=The insides of the cubes as well as the physical forces behind their levitation remain an enigma. Individual cubes as well as their combined structure retain a perfect symmetry and any attempts to physically disturb their positions have failed.@n@nWhat is even more puzzling is the analysis of the photonic spectroscopy of the cubes. They seem to emanate radiation of an unknown wavelength which excites the separation of electrons inside of the spectroscopic lens. While our science team refuses to jump to any conclusions, the Chief Engineer suggests that we should study the effect empirically on the Colony’s Solar Panels.@n@nThe science team requested permission to commence experimental research on the cubes' properties.@n@n<effect>New research on the mystery of the Black Cubes is now available
5883코0=We should rearrange our research priorities.
7191코0=Primary analysis of the Black Cubes revealed no conclusive answers. The cubes may somehow affect our Solar Panels. New Breakthrough research is now available.
5885코0=Power of Three: Post–benign
7192코0=Recent orbital scans revealed a sudden surge of energy on site. It’s now evident that the cubes pose a far greater threat than blocking our infrastructure plans.
5886코0=It appears the Black Cubes materialized inside the Extractor. We could only guess what happened to the building.@n@nIt seems any of the artifacts could materialize inside a structure, sending it into oblivion. We are now facing the potential threat of future human casualties.@n@nMission Control advises a top priority on the investigation of the disaster.@n@n<effect>More buildings could collapse in the future. Preventive research is now available.
5887코0=A potential solution! This is great news.
5888코0=We confirmed that the Extractor was destroyed by the Black Cubes. New preventive research is now available.
5889코0=Power of Three: A Time For Speculation
7193코0=The latest research confirms that the cubes seem to be interfacing with each other. Almost like they’re forming some kind of device.
5890코0=The science team is divided in two camps: those who speculate it will amplify the cube signals allowing them to transmit through the reaches of space, and those who believe it could be some kind of weapon meant for destruction, not communication.@n@nOutside the labs however, the cult of the Cubes has gained even more momentum. People are gathering to wait for what they think would be the coming of God to humanity’s second home.
5891코0=A culmination seems to be imminent, that’s for certain.
5892코0=Power of Three: Solace in Science
7194코0=We’ve applied the scientific method in every possible way to no avail. Time to try something else.
5893코0=In a moment of brilliance, or possibly desperation, one of the physicists proposed they should try to crack open the structures.@n@nThe scientists moved the cube matrix inside a non-baryonic shell and proceeded to bombard a single cube with high-energy ions, a process known as sputtering. The results were immediate – the shell of the cube gave in, resulting in its rapid decomposition. The matrix itself reacted to the influence by rearranging itself into a solid structure made of the remaining cubes.@n@nThough we have no explanation for the process, at least we have a way to deal with the cube matrices popping up everywhere. It appears that the exact solution rests on our reason and moderation.@n@n<effect>Cubes can be stored in special sites or destroyed
5894코0=Piece by piece, we will unravel this enigma.
5895코0=Dark Spectrometry research completed. We can now store and destroy the cubes.
5896코0=Power of Three: Embracing the Unknown
7195코0=The mystery of the black cubes has consumed our Colonists completely. The reactions are as numerous as they are varied.
5897코0=The Colonists have divided into factions centered around a certain hypothesis about the nature and purpose of the mysterious artifacts.@n@nThe excitement about the cubes is evident from the schedules of the weekly hearings in the Colony. The trivial themes such as the quality of the food and the requests for additional scientific funding had completely disappeared, replaced by requests for publicity for each faction’s viewpoint.@n@nSo far, there are three major camps. The moderate skeptics argue that the truth is hardly within our reach and cubes need to be preserved and stored for further research. The pessimistic ones insist on the destruction of all the cubes, seeing them as a deliberate threat. Then, there are those who hold the firm belief that the cubes are meant to be a gift to humanity from some unknown benevolent entity. They request the cubes to be transported inside the Domes and put on display for everyone to see.@n@n<effect>Decoration Buildings made out of cubes can be constructed.
5898코0=A gift or a Trojan horse, I wonder...
5899코0=Decorations can be created from the Black Cubes.
5900코0=Power of Three: Primal Fear
7196코0=We are attempting to make some sort of sense of the laws that govern the cubes’ behavior. But it’s like trying to find a needle in a haystack. In a pitch-black cave. While blindfolded.
5901코0=Still, our scientists managed to define to some extent why the cubes sometimes materialize inside our buildings. It seems that some cryptic algorithm first sends a pulse of tachyons to the area where the cube will materialize. If the Cherenkov radiation measurements are within certain limits, the cube appears on the spot. Thus, the cubes avoid appearing inside rocks – indeed, none of our scans confirmed that any cube spawned inside of a high-density object.@n@nOur structures tend to be much less dense than the monolithic Martian rocks. We can modify our sensor towers to create a fake Cherenkov Effect by bombarding the areas around our structures with particles which are harmless to our Colonists, but would still prevent the cubes from threatening our Colony.@n@n<effect>Sensor Towers now protect nearby buildings from the Black Cubes
5902코0=A small victory – our efforts continue.
5903코0=S.H.E.P.I.D. research completed. Buildings within range of our Sensor Towers will be protected from the cubes
5884코0=We should research the S.H.E.P.I.D. technology to protect the Colony structures from the Black Cubes
5904코0=All cubes on Mars have started to pulsate, counting towards an unknown event.
5905코0=Power of Three: The Countdown
7988코0=Within the hour all the cubes across the Colony started emitting light pulses, sending a wave of panic across the Colony. Even here at Mission Control we found it hard not to worry.
5906코0=The photovoltaic effect we observed earlier has completely disappeared. To make things worse, numerous glitches in the drone command software have our technicians scattering to extinguish fires all across the board. It seems that the pulses from the cubes are somehow interfering with the Drone uplink.@n@nAs reports are flowing in, we can clearly see a trend in the intensification of the light pulses. Is this some kind of countdown? And if so, to what?
5907코0=Just colonizing a new world isn’t interesting enough, it seems.
5908코0=Power of Three: Of Mice & Men
7989코0=Our Colonists want decisive action in dealing with the cubes.
5909코0=Some of them call for the immediate destruction of all the cubes while others still insist on storing and studying them – as far away from the Domes as possible. And yet, the number of eccentrics worshiping the cubes and erecting monuments with them has grown even larger. Could the cubes be affecting us like they influenced our drones?
5910코0=We must not lose focus.
5911코0=Power of Three: Construction Begins
7990코0=Looks like we're fighting the cubes for the control of our drones. And we are losing that battle.
5912코0=Between their usual command cycles, the drones have begun carrying cubes to a specific location and seem to be constructing a strange structure.@n@nDiagnostics on the drone software and hardware reveal no clues for any reprogramming. All of our attempts to gather information about the purpose of this operation have failed.@n@nMission Control advises all personnel to brace for the unknown.@n@n<effect>Some Drones are constructing a mystery building with the cubes.
5913코0=At least our Drones aren't attacking us yet.
5914코0=Affected Drones are building something of alien design.
5915코0=Unknown Construction
5916코0=Drones influenced by the cubes have started the construction of a Mega Monolith
7991코0=Once completed, the monument emitted a pulse of all-encompassing energy and we all experienced a single collective dream! Or memory? 
5918코0=Eons ago, while Earth was still a molten world, Mars had already been a teeming, living world covered by oceans and forests. This long-forgotten Mars was the home for a sentient race which quickly mastered their primitive urges and reached technological peaks yet to be conquered by humankind.@n@nWe witnessed the astonishing evolution of the Ancients and the countless metamorphoses they experienced until they reached a state of existence which allowed them to transcend the boundaries of the material form. Without worrying about resources or lifespan, they traversed the universe, leaving their home behind. But they have not forgotten it.@n@nThe robust Black Cubes lay in wait on the Red Planet for a meeting of the minds. Our actions here were detected by the semi-sentient algorithm which controlled the cubes and triggered the message left by the Ancients. Some of the accounts given by our personnel describe being talked to in a language both familiar and thoroughly alien, while others describe being shown images most vivid and influencing. Some would even account for experiencing a sort of judgment. The essence of the information was, however, without exception, the same.
5919코0=I saw it, too...
7992코0=The Ancients were pleased to see we had reacted with restraint and curiosity, trying to understand the unknown phenomenon instead of fearing it. 
5920코0=Judging from their own history, they assume this was not necessarily an easy thing to do.@n@nThey recall the fondest epochs of their history, where such strivings were predominant amongst them. Proud and nostalgic, they offer us a gift.@n@n<effect>Gained a new Technology, <em><reg_param1></em>
5922코0=We communed with the Ancients in our collective dream. They were impressed by our curiosity.
7993코0=The Ancients were set back by the hostile reaction we had towards their messengers – the cubes.
5923코0=Ultimately they expressed understanding, noting that there were times in their own long history, dark times when they had the same hostile response towards the unknown.@n@nThey hope that with time and maturity we will come to embrace the idea that while the universe is a dangerous place, not everything is a threat and there are also wonders to be discovered.@n@n<effect>All Black Cubes have disappeared@n<effect>Gained a new Technology, <em><reg_param1></em>
5924코0=We communed with the Ancients in our collective dream. They were somewhat surprised by our hostility against the unknown.
7994코0=The Ancients were intrigued and quite surprised by our choice to indulge in creations of art with their cubes.
5925코0=Oblivious to the concept of higher powers, they seemed to see no other reason for our actions other than a pursuit of aesthetic decoration, one that seems to have eluded them as a possibility.@n@nNot quite sure what to make of this, they express hope we will retain our creativity as a race in the ages ahead.@n@n<effect>The monument collapsed into a pile of Black Cubes@n<effect>Gained a new Technology, <em><reg_param1></em>
5921코0=It has been quite the ride.
5926코0=We communed with the Ancients in a collective dream. They were impressed by our creativity.
5917코0=Power of Three: Out of the Eons
7995코0=The moment the last cube fit in the structure, we detected a single, intense beam of high-energy particles directed towards the cosmos. What could it mean?
5927코0=Meanwhile, reports from all over the Colony indicate that all cubes have ceased their pulsating and reverted to their previous lifeless state. Many Colonists report to the medical facilities that they feel different states of depression – ranging from melancholy to outright despair. Could these events be attributed to the mysterious structure and the death of the cubes? We would never find out.@n@n<effect>All Colonists suffer penalties to Morale.
5928코0=Perhaps we should've done more
5929코0=We didn't get to the bottom of the mystery of the Black Cubes. Perhaps more decisive action was needed.
7197코0=<red>The mystery of the Cubes remains unresolved</red>
5930코0=Power of Three: For the Generations to Witness
7996코0=The cubes can’t be ignored. 
5931코0=It would be irresponsible to mismanage the situation and leave public opinion to sway back and forth on the matter.@n@nWith the current state of events we lack sufficient data to judge the purpose of the cubes. It could take years if not generations of scientific research to reach a conclusion on that subject. Until then, we will attempt to control the erratic spread of the cubes which hampers our resources and colonization operations by storing them away in a convenient manner.
5932코0=Only time will tell if we are right.
5933코0=Power of Three: Might Makes Right
7997코0=The primary goal of our mission is the permanent colonization of Mars. Any potential threat to humanity’s pioneers is to be eliminated.
5934코0=We will attempt to remove all the cubes from our immediate area. A decision as serious as this required a consensus, which was reached through a vote at Mission Control. The public may deem this decision wrong, but we cannot place the fate of the entire Colony on our desire to wait it out. History had taught us that the inability to act often results in disaster. The destruction of cubes will proceed as planned.
5935코0=Humanity will prevail, no matter the cost.
5936코0=Power of Three: Cult of Tomorrow
7998코0=The idea that we are not alone in the universe and could become part of a bigger whole has swept over the Colony.
5937코0=To disregard the desires of our Colonists would be a monstrous, autocratic act.@n@nMission Control has officially allowed the creation of a series of monuments dedicated to the Higher Truth proclaimed by some of our most active Colonists. We must look into ourselves and at our history as a species – denying the possibility that these people are right would mean that we are no better than the fanatics who burned visionaries at the pyres because of their beliefs.
5938코0=It would be tyranny to forbid this.
5939코0=Power of Three: Singularity Imminent
7198코0=The argument was that hindering the construction of the Mega-Monument would give us enough time to prepare for any possible risks. The argument was wrong.
5940코0=The obscure algorithm or – perish the thought! - the intelligence directing the construction has commanded otherwise. Within mere hours, the super-structure dematerialized, decaying to its basic components, and reappeared, commanding our drones to proceed with its construction anew.@n@nThe creators of the structure definitely want us to finish their plan. The potential risk from yesterday has now become a tangible menace and I don't believe that anyone in the Colony lives under the illusion that it is avoidable.@n@n<effect>All Colonists suffer Sanity loss due to the threatening behavior of the Mega-Monument Construction.
5941코0=Ominous news. We must be ready for anything.
5942코0=Meteors incoming from the Koronis asteroid cluster are about to intercept the Earth and Mars orbits.
5943코0=The Dredger that lands excavates something from the planet's surface. Sending an expedition crew to analyze this location will shed light on the Dredgers' behavior.
5944코0=Dredger Encounter: Alpha
5945코0=A Dredger excavated something at this position and then took off. Sending an expedition crew to analyze this location will shed light on the Dredger behavior.
5946코0=Dredger Excavation Site: Alpha
5947코0=Send an expedition to observe and examine the landed Dredger to boost our Dredger Morhpology tech
5948코0=Dredger Landing Site
5949코0=The Dredgers: Contact
7448코0=Mission Control, we’ve received the preliminary report from the landing site expedition. The RC Explorer is on-site, awaiting further orders.
5950코0=From the spectroscopic data gathered from afar, we know that the object is covered in a robust crust of silicates and metal despite its organic appearance. The tentacle-like protrusions are inanimate and it seems they serve as support columns for the main structure. The operators reports no activity from the object except its continuous excavation – it is either inanimate or it pays no heed to our presence in the area.@n@nThe RC Explorer operator requests permission for close inspection on the object.
5951코0=Affirmative. Proceed with caution.
5952코0=Negative. The risk is too high.
7449코0=The Explorer completed the close inspection of the Object without any major problems.
5954코0=The rover ventured within mere meters of the Object and conducted a series of field tests and observations on it. We scanned it with radiological and spectroscopic equipment and extended a remote probe to its carapace, gathering tiny samples of its crust. Via its telescopic arm a camera and sonar were inserted within the Object, revealing a perplexing maze of cavities and corridors inside. A close inspection below the Object shows that it digs a hole beneath itself through a rotation of its frontal hull and extracts metal-rich ores, but its position above the ground level remains the same. The RC Explorer operators report no response from the Object during any of these operations.@n@nThe data we've gathered is already sent to our sponsor via encrypted transmission. We are sure the commission will value our efforts greatly.@n@n<effect>You've gained <funding(reg_param1)> Funding and <research(reg_param2)>.@n@n<hint>The Object extracts resources from below the surface.
5955코0=Fortune favors the brave
5953코0=The Dredgers: The Belly of the Beast
7450코0=We completed the close inspection of the Object, though the expedition rover’s malfunctions were a heavy price pay.
5956코0=The RC Explorer ventured within mere meters of the Object and conducted series of field tests and observations on it. The operators scanned the Object with radiological and spectroscopic equipment and extended a remote probe to its carapace, gathering tiny samples of its crust. When the RC Explorer approached the Object to perform closer interaction with it via the telescopic arms, the digging process of the Object caused a minor crust collapse and it nearly smashed the front of the rover’s hull. This didn't appear to be a deliberate attack but the damage is evident – it seems the Object possesses immense strength as well.@n@nDespite our setbacks we gathered important data and have already sent it to our sponsor via encrypted transmission. We are sure the commission will value our efforts greatly.@n@n<effect>You've gained <funding(reg_param1)> Funding. The RC Explorer suffered a malfunction.@n@n<hint>The Object extracted resources from below the surface.
5957코0=We knew the risks but it was worth it.
5958코0=The Dredgers: Foresight and Reflection
7451코0=We can try to inspect the Object more closely once we’ve properly evaluated the risks.
5959코0=The RC Explorer will be returning to base soon. Meanwhile, we will continue to gather visual and telemetry data on the object. The data we've gathered is already sent to our sponsor via encrypted transmission. We are sure the commission will value our efforts greatly.@n@n<effect>You receive <funding(reg_param1)> Funding.@n@n<hint>The Object extracted metals from below the surface.
5960코0=Better safe than sorry
5961코0=The Dredgers: Behind the Scenes
7452코0=While the Object may have left Mars, it also left an indelible mark on our minds and on the face of the planet.
5962코0=The large hole left behind by the Object was the focus of the expedition, and the RC Explorer operators did their best to scavenge every bit of information left behind. With the help of the its telescopic arms and on-board spectroscopic equipment, the RC Explorer helped us find out that the hole was dug up on top of a subsurface resource deposit. The amount of discarded waste rock as well as the volume of the hole suggested that the Object sifted through the soil and took away only the usable bits. What the purpose of this was is unknown.@n@n<hint>The Object extracted resources from below the surface and took off with them
5963코0=This only makes the mystery deeper.
7453코0=Mission Control, we’ve got our first detailed analysis of a landed Dredger.
5965코0=The RC Explorer used molecular spectroscopy to scan the Rubidium-Strontium proportions on the outer shell of the Dredger and the results are astonishing! It seems that the outer shell of the Dredger is extremely new, as if it has been created years ago!@n@nSome of our scientists proposed that the Dredgers must originate from our Solar System, unless they can traverse immense distances in a flash.@n@n<effect>The Dredger Morphology technology receives a 50% Boost.
5966코0=If this is true, how could we have missed them for so long?
7454코0=Mission Control, we’ve got RC Explorer operators reporting in from the Dredger analysis site.
5967코0=The expedition leader took the initiative to make physical contact with the landed Dredger. Risking it, he ordered the RC Explorer to approach the imposing alien object with a sampling tool and scrape off a portion of its outer hull, nervously anticipating a hostile reaction. The Dredger did nothing, so the RC Explorer ventured closer to it, taking more samples of its hull and probing its insides with various scanning equipment.@n@nIt is now evident that the outer shell of the Dredger consists of silicates and heavy inert metals with no traces of organic materials. The inner walls of the jet vents contain traces of burned alkaline metals. Some of our scientists propose that they are the fuel used to propel the Dredger during flight and take-off.@n@nThe object demonstrated no interest in the activities of the rover. The scientists speculate that it lacks any sort of sensors or processing power whatsoever.@n@n<effect>The Dredger Morphology technology receives a 50% Boost.
5968코0=So we are talking about a machine or a very primitive organism? Maybe both?
5964코0=The Dredgers: A Curious Observation
7455코0=An RC Explorer has just completed analyzing a Dredger.
5969코0=After our operators made their brave approach and even touched the previous Dredger, no one feels intimidated by the large alien landers. The RC Explorer operators have even begun nicknaming the Dredgers with cute names such as Big Betty. While this raises the morale of the Colony, the scientists are excited to work with the large inflow of samples and data.@n@n<effect>Dredger Morphology technology receives a 50% Boost.
5970코0=Name one Cthulhu just for me, OK?
7456코0=Our science team is busy with the scant remains of the destroyed Dredger.
5972코0=The spectacular explosion revealed that the Dredger lacks mechanical components, its warped internal components resembling organs more than devices. The mysteries behind such a technology have already inspired some of our greatest minds. The Head Scientist called this the project of the century and one can clearly hear the excitement in his voice.@n@n<effect>The Dredger Wavelength Decoding receives a 50% Boost
5973코0=Keep up the good work.
5971코0=The Dredgers: The Chinese Puzzle
7457코0=An RC Explorer just brought in materials salvaged from another destroyed Dredger.
5974코0=More samples would allow our scientists to apply more aggressive experimentation and analytical methods, speeding up their work immensely.@n@n<effect>The Dredger Wavelength Decoding receives a 50% Boost
5975코0=The Dredgers: Convergence
7458코0=Mission Control, we’re receiving a priority transmission from Earth.
5976코0=Several hours ago, the LINEAR and CSS programs detected an incoming cluster of meteorites from the asteroid belt. Their trajectories are likely to converge with the Martian orbit. Meteor impacts are likely to intensify during the course of the next few weeks.@n@n<effect>Expect several Meteor Storms to hit Mars in the next <text_param1> Sols.
5978코0=All personnel – keep calm and watch for meteors.
5979코0=The Dredgers: The Heavenly Storm
7459코0=Mission Control, we’ve got an update on the status of the meteor storms. And it’s not looking good.
5980코0=The initial evaluation of the situation with the meteor clusters had been miscalculated. The scientists from the near-Earth object detection programs predict that a significant amount of the meteorite stream would fill the space between Mars and Earth. While the thick atmosphere of our home world would protect it from eventual impacts, the threat level for any spacecraft will be past tolerable. To address the new situation, Earth Control has canceled all space flights until further notice.@n@n<effect>Rockets will not arrive until the situation with the meteor impacts is resolved. Inbound rockets will still land on Mars.
5981코0=We must maintain strict regulations over our supplies until then.
5982코0=Severe meteor activity is preventing interplanetary travel. Rockets cannot be requested from Earth.
5983코0=The Dredgers: Brace for Impact
7460코0=All stations on red alert! Unidentified object on course for direct impact!
5984코0=Mission Control, our sensors are detecting a large object incoming at high velocity. Judging by the data from our telemetry, its mass and speed are great enough to cause major damage on the surface. It would be wise to evacuate the area around the projected point of impact.@n@nWe could be wrong, but our initial visual readings on the object show that it has an unconventional form for a meteorite. Strange protrusions can be observed from the back of the object. Could this be something different than a meteor?@n@n<effect>A major impact is expected to happen somewhere on Mars.
5985코0=Stay focused and don’t jump to conclusions.
7461코0=Planetfall. We finally get a visual on the target as the dust settles. No one at Mission Control can believe their eyes.
5987코0=We haven't seen anything like it – and it doesn't look like something man made. I don't want to overstate things, but this could be a First Contact situation.
5988코0=Let’s see what we can see.
5986코0=The Dredgers: Grounding Day
7462코0=Mission Control, you’re not going to believe this – we couldn’t either. Whatever this thing is, it’s not a meteor.
5989코0=The object hit the surface without decelerating. We expected it to burst into pieces from the force of impact, but it seems it possesses immense structural integrity. The most astonishing thing is that it has moving parts. From what we have observed so far, it seems that it is trying to burrow below the crust of the planet.@n@nIt is now or never to take a closer look – should the risk be worth it.@n@n<effect>An Anomaly at the landing site is available for analysis.
5990코0=Maintain safe distance and stand by for further orders.
5991코0=A mysterious alien object has landed on Mars and is excavating resources. We have to send an Expedition to investigate it on site.
5992코0=The Dredgers: Egress
7463코0=Mission Control, the unidentified object has left Martian airspace and is now heading towards the asteroid belt.
5993코0=As abruptly as it came, the object took off and accelerated extremely quickly. Our initial predictions that it would dig itself deeper in the crust have proven wrong. Instead, from our observation on the landing site, we can conclude that a large amount of Martian soil had been removed and taken away. What the goal and the purpose of this operation was is unknown.@n@n<effect>The object has taken off.
5994코0=Watch the skies – something tells me there will be more of this.
5995코0=The mysterious alien codenamed Dredger has taken off.
5996코0=The Dredgers: They Will Be Back
7464코0=Mission Control! We’ve detected another incoming object.
5997코0=The similarities with the first Object are obvious, but we cannot confirm the identity on the new one. Our scientists speculate that it would land in another mineral rich region. Our sponsor suggests that we maintain visual contact with the Object but keep our distance as its intentions or its defensive capabilities are unknown.@n@nOur sponsor’s contacts on Earth rifled through any data for a mission launched by another competitor on Earth, but from what we have seen so far it wouldn’t be far-fetched to suggest that these Objects are of extraterrestrial origin.@n@nBy the way, the sponsor HQ dubbed the Object Dredger and they require us to maintain coherency in our documentation by using the same call-sign.@n@n<effect>A new Dredger is about to land on Mars.
5998코0=Whatever they call it, it’s still our problem.
5999코0=More Dredgers continue to land on Mars in search of resources.
6000코0=The Dredgers: Happy Reunion
7465코0=Mission Control, the ban on space flights has been lifted.
6001코0=This happened after our sponsor's council reviewed our report on the Dredgers. With the current development, we know that more and more Dredgers land on Mars to extract large amounts of subsurface metals which, combined with the ban on space flights, would endanger the future of the Colony. Our observations on the Dredgers' flight trajectories indicate that they are heading exclusively to Mars and that the threat for interplanetary vessels has lessened, which was confirmed by the CSS and LINEAR.@n@n<effect>Rockets can travel between Mars and Earth once more.
6002코0=Finally!
6003코0=The ban on interplanetary flights was lifted. We can now request help from Earth.
6004코0=The Dredgers: Hands Full
7466코0=Sol after Sol, our scientists worked their fingers to the bone trying to find a solution to our incoming Dredger problem. No such luck.
6005코0=The problem is the lack of information – so far, we know very little about the nature of the Dredgers. To us they appear as inscrutable as natural events were to our forefathers. The science team requests more data on the objects and, if possible, a closer inspection of several different targets.@n@n<effect>New Research available: Dredger Morphology@n@n<hint>You can boost your Technology Research rate by analyzing landed Dredgers.
6006코0=Operation authorized.
6007코0=Scientists are working on a project to analyze the structure of the Dredgers. Expeditions near landed Dredgers will help their effort.
6008코0=The Dredgers: Fire at Will
7467코0=Mission Control, we've got an incoming message from our sponsor. An encrypted one.
6009코0=The council of our sponsor has authorized us to use force when dealing with the Dredgers. They put the future of the Colony as the utmost priority.
6010코0=It’s comforting to know that our actions have political backing.
6011코0=The Dredgers: The Koronis Predicament
7468코0=A recent detailed analysis of the Dredgers revealed that they're sending signals towards the Koronis asteroid cluster.
6012코0=This occasional discovery was made later rather than sooner, as the emissions are cleverly masked to resemble cosmic rays in their wavelength. It is apparent that the source of the landers is closer than we thought.@n@nThe science team immediately requested permission to “dissect” one of the Dredgers to get their hands on the mysterious device used to send these transmissions.@n@n<effect>A new research is available – Dredger Wavelength Decoding.@n@n<hint>Destroy Dredgers using Drones to gain a Tech Boost towards the Technology’s progress.
6013코0=Time to stop whistling in the dark.
6014코0=Scientists are working on a project to decode the communications used by the Dredgers. Expeditions to the locations of destroyed Dredgers will help their effort.
6015코0=The Dredgers: Dark Omens
7469코0=The aliens didn't try to destroy our cities. Then again, they didn't try to contact us, either.
6016코0=Still, what started out as a single contact quickly grew into series of regular visits. Even when our “guests” are not blaster-toting gray men, they cause damage to our Colony in subtle and cruel ways. As more and more Dredgers continue to land on the surface, the future of the Colony could be threatened by the lack of sufficient metallic resources. It is a sad conclusion, but our first contact with alien life could turn into a race for survival.@n@nOur scientists suggest that with the current rate of landings the amount of metals in our sector will be depleted within three years – and some of the most pessimistic of our colleagues believe that the trend is for the landings to become more frequent. This would be a terrible prospect.
6017코0=Arrange a team meeting – we have to work out a solution.
6018코0=The Dredgers: Into the Light
7470코0=We've got another problem on the horizon. A potentially devastating one.
6019코0=A famous leaks site has just released leaked logs and reports from our Colony. They concentrate exclusively on the Dredgers and elaborate on the evidence that we have contacted an alien civilization.@n@nOur sponsors were probably foolish enough to believe that a secret can remain hidden from the public in the Age of Information. The uproar is tremendous and the UN calls for an emergency press conference. The monitoring council of our sponsor was insistent on our participation in the event. It will be held via the interplanetary network. We’ll be the center of attention. The time-lag will give us fifteen minutes between questions to think of the best way to answer.@n@nThere is no reason to hide the truth now.
6020코0=Good golly!
6021코0=A hearing on the Dredgers matters and a press conference at the United Nations Assembly will be held soon.
6022코0=The Dredgers: Press Conference
7471코0=The conference at the United Nations is about to begin. We’ll be transcribing the communication on the fly, give or take five minutes or so.
6023코0=Mr. President; Mr. Secretary General; fellow delegates; ladies and gentlemen:@n@nFor many centuries, humans have speculated that, in the great expanse of the universe, there should be life. Humanity never dismissed their hope for contact and so, even before we could reach for the stars, we built machines to probe the space for signs of the existence of others. Until recently, our attempts were met with silence and we had to rely only on our unshakable belief. But today we have proof. We are not alone.@n@nAllow me to introduce you to the Commander of Mars Alpha, our first Colony on the Red Planet, who will personally address your questions.
6024코0=We can’t speak to contact or conflict, but rather about unforeseen competition...
6025코0=To talk about making contact with a sentient race is rather premature...
6026코0=The Dredgers: Press Conference: The Race is On
7472코0=What we can confirm is that the automated vessels we encountered were of unknown origin.
6027코0=The vessels dismissed all of our attempts to communicate and proceeded with their only mission – to consume and transport resources from the surface of Mars. In another time we would address their activity with affectionate curiosity and excitement, but in the light of our current situation, this has caused great distress and concern in all personnel of Mars Alpha. Without bothering you with the tiresome technical details, the extraction and utilization of Martian resources is crucial to the success of Mars Alpha and our ability to settle in the Solar System.@n@nOur Colony's safety and viability is our utmost priority. This is why I’ve personally supervised operations to deny the alien vessels the opportunity to extract and steal away the metal deposits crucial to our survival. I would ask those who might raise questions on the measure of our reaction – what do you call a neighbor who deliberately tries to stall your attempts to lead a better life?
7317코0=Continue
6028코0=The Dredgers: Press Conference: Contact Denied
7473코0=Humanity’s imagination has always portrayed contact with an alien species as either a precursor to military conflict or a chance for peaceful exchange of culture and ideas.
6029코0=At their core of our expectations has always been a flawed assumption – that an alien race would be psychologically human.@n@nThe first contact, if one has the audacity to call it that way, was with a system of automated mining equipment. As disappointing as it may sound, the alien machines displayed an almost offensive disregard for our presence. So far they had followed their simple purpose – to extract resources from the surface of Mars. The nature and intentions of their creators remains a mystery and our best minds are working towards unveiling it.
7318코0=Continue
6030코0=The Dredgers: Press Conference - Hard Questions
7474코0=After the applause dies down, the delegates proceed to question our sponsor’s committee as to the details of their encounter with the Dredgers.
6031코0=They handle most of the questions with ease and require little input from you. And then you are confronted with a direct question from one of the delegates.@n@n“An anonymous yet reliable source disclosed to us that you ordered and succeeded in the deliberate destruction of at least one of the alien vessels. My country condemns any premature aggressive actions which could taint the reputation of humankind, especially when addressing such a delicate matter. What gave you the authority to act in such a risky manner without an official resolution from the Council of the United Nations?”
6032코0=The prosperity of our Colony is our first and only concern...
6033코0=This is not an act of aggression but instead a step towards mutual understanding...
6034코0=The Dredgers: Press Conference – United We Stand
7475코0=Honorable delegates, we stand at the doorway to a new era, taking those first hesitant steps towards the stars beyond. Allowing fear and doubt to sway us from our path would fail not only Mars Alpha, but us as a species.
6035코0=For countless generations the human species had proven to possess the ability to adapt, survive and thrive. Let us not forget who we are.@n@nThe actions I ordered were not an act of war and aggression, but instead were means to secure the future of our initiative and fulfill a promise to all people on Earth. Dismantling several alien vessels is a fair price to pay for what's at stake today. And if the creators of these vessels see our actions as something more than doing the right thing, we will prove them wrong. For we do not desire to take what's not ours – we want to fulfill our destiny as a space-faring species.
7319코0=Continue
6037코0=You not only managed to persuade the public to support our efforts, but also inspired millions of people around the world who watched the live-stream.@n@nYour influence will aid the Colony greatly.@n@n<effect>The United Nations transferred resources to the Mars Alpha project. You've gained <funding(reg_param1)> Funding.
6038코0=I'm glad the UN understood the importance of our mission.
6039코0=The United Nations were persuaded to support the Colony with increased funding.
6040코0=Press Conference 2: A Bridge to Build
7477코0=I would only take issue with half of the statement given by our honorable delegate. While we did indeed dismantle the vessel, I would hardly paint our intent as an expression of the darker side of human nature.
6041코0=Our goal was to make sense of what's happening, of the nature of the alien vessels, which is one of the underlying principles of science.@n@nOur efforts were not in vain. The greatest minds of Mars Alpha and Earth managed to make amazing progress. Dismantling the probe allowed us to make sense of the communications of the alien machines, maybe even the basis of the language of their creators, and not only that. The scientific knowledge we gained from this event will speed our way to the stars, where even more puzzling mysteries await those of us who have the bravery and integrity to face the unknown.
7320코0=Continue
6036코0=The Dredgers: Press Conference – A Battle Well Fought
7476코0=By the looks on the faces of the audience, your words have made a lasting mark.
6042코0=You not only managed to persuade the public to support our efforts, but also inspired millions of people around the world who watched the live-stream.@n@nYour influence will aid the Colony greatly.@n@n<effect> Public opinion for Mars Alpha increased. Additional <reg_param1> Applicants are available.
6043코0=I feel like a rock star.
6044코0=Millions of people on Earth were inspired by the press-conference and more and more Applicants are willing to colonize Mars.
6045코0=The Dredgers: Darkened Skies
7478코0=Warning! We’ve got a red alert!
6046코0=The scanners have gone crazy with the signatures of dozens of Dredgers heading our way. The Dredger transmissions repeat a signal we can interpret only as “urgency eat/dig”. On the screen they look like a swarm of locusts and we presume their goal is similar.@nThe mission sponsor has authorized a forceful response.@n@n<effect>Multiple Dredgers detected! They will arrive within <text_param1> Sols.
7199코0=5
6047코0=Multiple Dredgers are bound to land on Mars and harvest our resources!
6049코0=As sudden as they fell upon us, the alien vessels are taking off all at once. Our scientists are just starting to estimate the exact amount of precious resources that have been irreparably lost, but the preliminary reports are promising. We've survived!@n@nPleased with our performance, the monitoring council of our sponsor offered us their financial support as a stimulus.@n@n<effect>You destroyed <reg_param1> Dredgers during the mass landing. Based on the Dredgers destroyed, the mission sponsor provided a bounty of <funding(reg_param2)> Funding.
6050코0=We’ll do it again if we have to!
6048코0=The Dredgers: Darkened Skies – Debrief
7479코0=Mission Control, the Dredgers are retreating!
6051코0=As sudden as they fell upon us, the alien vessels are taking off all at once. Our scientists estimate they extracted a significant amount of materials from below the surface. This is a serious threat to the viability of our Colony and the monitoring council of our sponsor took that in mind. They offered us a small sum as a disaster relief, but from the subtle remarks in their message we can tell they are not happy with the situation.@n@n<effect>You've gained <funding(reg_param1)> Funding as disaster relief.
6053코0=We have survived the Dredger invasion. Teams are working on evaluating the damage.
6054코0=The Dredgers: The Leviathan Rises
7480코0=Red alert! We have a massive object converging with Mars on a collision course!
6055코0=Our readings confirm that this is a Dredger, but its size... There is no mistake, unfortunately.@n@nIf we leave this massive Dredger unchecked, it could have a disastrous impact on our metal supply. On the other hand, our Tactical Advisor supposes that the arrival of this new Dredger may be caused by the threat our actions proved for the aliens' mining operations. At the end, the decision as to how we address the new situation was obvious.@n@nJust when we thought we survived the worst...@n@n<effect>A huge Dredger will land on Mars in <text_param1> Sols.@n@n<hint>You can dismantle the incoming Dredger using Drones.
7200코0=5
6052코0=Cosmos help us!
6056코0=A massive Dredger is inbound to land on Mars.
6057코0=The Dredgers – Conclusion: Fires of Tomorrow's Dawn
7481코0=We all watched as the Dredger collapsed into a blazing inferno. A spectacular end. While some at Mission Control cheered, others simply stared, their concerns unvoiced.
6058코0=The comm-feed from the dying Dredger report a singular message broadcast towards the Koronis cluster – “retreat”, “retreat”. Others may wonder, but you know deep inside that you beheaded the beast – the other Dredgers won't be coming back.@n@nSomehow you don't feel like the victor. You stand silent as you ask yourself one question – have you defeated a dangerous enemy or rebuffed a potential ally?@n@n<effect>Xeno-Extraction Technology is available for research with a 100% Boost@n<effect>Gained a new technology, <em><reg_param1></em>
6060코0=We have destroyed the massive Dredger and salvaged samples and information on its unique excavation methods – Xeno-Extraction Tech is now available. The alien vessels are gone forever.
6061코0=The Dredgers – Conclusion: Crossroads
7482코0=Standing in the shoulder-to-shoulder crush of Mission Control, the deep thrum of take-off is almost more felt than heard. It’s not long before the Dredger is a wink in the distance, massive payload and all.
6062코0=The cheerful chorus of the Dredger communications is too confusing to understand, but this is pointless as their behavior clearly marks their intentions. The visual feed on the Koronis cluster shows how thousands of bright dots light the sky as the swarm of Dredgers breaks its silence. The satellites track their movement as the swarm gathers around the massive Dredger and the alien vessels head towards the end of the Solar System.@n@nYou failed to destroy the massive Dredger and the Colony will pay the price in the months to come, but maybe this is for the better. Maybe today humanity avoided retribution from the unknown creators of the Dredgers, or started on the path of cooperation, and maybe even friendship, when the next generations reach the stars.@n@n<effect>Xeno-Extraction Technology is available for research@n<effect>Gained a new technology, <em><reg_param1></em>
6059코0=Only time will tell.
6063코0=The massive Dredger has taken off and converged with the alien fleet on a course leading far from the Solar System. They’ve left forever. We now have the Xeno-Extraction Tech project based on what we know about the Dredgers.
6064코0=The Dredgers: Knowing the Unknown
7483코0=We’ve completed the final analysis of the Dredgers but, as is all too common with the mysteries we encounter, it raises more questions than it answers.
6065코0=The scientists concluded that the organic appearance of the Dredgers is misleading. Even though their robust hulls are made to endure extreme impact forces, they are deprived of any sensors and react in no way to changes in their environment. Simply put, they are nothing more than extraction vehicles with simple programming.@n@nHere comes the best part – the Dredgers are quite vulnerable! The alkaloid fuels they utilize for propulsion makes them highly volatile in oxygen-rich atmospheres. This is probably the reason why no Dredger landed on Earth so far.@nIt is a tough decision whether we should use force against the Dredgers.@n@n<effect>You can now use Drones to destroy Dredgers
6066코0=Hostilities should be our last resort.
6067코0=They came uninvited and I believe it is our right to defend what is ours.
6068코0=We have researched a way to destroy landed Dredgers by using Drones.
6069코0=The Dredgers: The Language
7484코0=We’ve done it. Our science team has deciphered the so-called language of the Dredgers.
6070코0=Each transmission consists of several desynchronized threads – each of them sounds like cosmic static, but when combined in the right way they form a pattern which can be translated to binary.@n@nThe information transmitted by the Dredgers is surprisingly simple. They share data regarding plotted courses, the status of their excavations and the location of mineral-rich sites. We cannot identify the source in Koronis as the Dredgers do not use any call signs, but nevertheless we are able to intercept their transmissions and predict the sites of future landings.@n@n<effect>Dredger landing sites will be marked on the map.
6071코0=Inform me immediately if you intercept anything unusual.
6072코0=We have researched a way to detect the future landing sites of Dredgers.
7485코0=Can’t decide if this is good news or bad.
7113코0=The Colony is expecting some sort of artificial cold wave. How’s that even possible?
7486코0=It is also confirmed that the Spheres are no longer splitting and are simply using their energies to maintain atmospheric stasis – in other words they have reached the critical mass needed for their purpose. @n@nWhat or who needs to lower the atmospheric temperature of contemporary Mars is beyond any of us – yet it is most evident that the Spheres are effective at what they are doing. @n@nIf we want to stop the change, we must find a breakthrough based on what we already know and learn how to control or cancel this process.@n@n<effect> A prolonged, extremely strong Cold Wave has begun.@n<effect> Xeno-Terraforming research available.
7487코0=This is now formally a fight for survival.
7488코0=Our scientists are confident that we have recorded and gathered all data necessary for making sense of this encounter in the coming decades. Also, they are confident that the Spheres themselves had overstayed their welcome. @n@nKeeping them around would have meant living with the ever present danger of re-activating the endless cold wave once more and caused harm to our Colony as they did before. @n@nAnd despite the risks, despite the purely pragmatic reasons for destroying all the Spheres, one can’t help but wonder how the generations to come will feel of this deed. Will we go down in history as cowards? Or maybe as too insensitive to the magnitude of the encounter, the very first non-man made technology ever found?@n@nWhen our scientists give up on trying to determine the origin of these Spheres, will textbooks mention that because of the rash actions and fears of the few pioneers that lived on Mars at the time, the riddle will never be solved?@n@n<effect>No more Spheres are left.@n<effect>Gained a new Technology, <em><reg_param1></em>.
6073코0=We discovered a mysterious sphere half-buried in the red sands. Its origins and purpose remain unknown.
6074코0=The ominous Sphere has burst from the ground and is floating in an unknown direction.
6075코0=The Sphere has started draining energy from the ground and from our power grid.
6076코0=The harmful energy-draining aura of the Sphere has affected nearby Colonists, damaging their health. Mission Control advises extreme caution near the alien objects.
6077코0=The Sphere has used the energy it stored to create another copy of itself. Our scientists predict that the process will continue while also accelerating the coming of some related event.
6078코0=The power decoys worked! A Sphere is now trapped in one of them. If everything works, it will remain there until we can sustain the power feed of the decoy.
6079코0=The Sphere obeyed our commands and has crash-landed on the surface. We can now safely harvest resources from the deposits left behind.
6080코0=We have invented Power Decoys – buildings which should allow us to attract and trap a Sphere on a specific location.
6081코0=The Spheres had started to terraform Mars, draining it of its energy and making it colder – a massive Cold Wave has began!
6082코0=Success! We managed to disable all of the Spheres!
6083코0=Inner Light: The Advent
6084코0=It is so unexpectedly pleasant that any fears of food or drug poisoning are quickly doused and forgotten. And then you hear the voices – people laughing, yelling, crying... speaking. The language is incomprehensible but you sense the presence of friendly and strangely familiar entities. The shimmering lights start forming patterns and sparks flash briefly, revealing scenes from another place.@n@nYou struggle to concentrate and maintain control and the mirage dissolves. You're left alone and confused in the command room.
7201코0=Sitting at your desk, a strange light appears in the corner of your vision. It pulsates and intensifies, bathing the room in a warm glow. It feels... Actually, it feels just about right.
6085코0=What just happened...?
6086코0=You have witnessed bizarre hallucinations with no logical explanation.
6087코0=Inner Light: Wake Up Call
6088코0=“Multiple signals from the Colony are coming in and everyone at Mission Control is worried. People are falling asleep on the streets and at their work stations, some report vivid hallucinations. The affected Colonists express symptoms of high stress and have been put under medical supervision. We’ve also exchanged information with Earth Control but they report no activity on their end. It seems the event is localized on Mars.”
7202코0=And you’re not the only one who’s seen this odd mirage.
6089코0=This mystery is only getting deeper.
6090코0=The mirages have affected others as well. Colonists experience visual hallucinations and some have entered a trance-like state.
6092코0=When you open your eyes, you find yourself hundreds of meters above the ground. The panic overtakes you and you wave your limbs frantically as you try to grasp something. Despite the fact that you aren't falling – a strong rope supports you near the trunk of a gigantic tree, taller than any skyscraper. You compose yourself just on time to hear your sister laughing way above you.@n@n“What are you doing, Kal? Stop it, silly!” You hear her voice directly in your mind. The realization of where you are hits you with full force. You remember that your name is Kal. That you and your numerous Clan call this tree Home.@n@nYou take a deep breath and look at the horizon, the bright sun is almost completely covered by thick veil of red and orange.
7203코0=It’s so much stronger this time - you manage to fight it for a minute or two before you sink into a hypnotic slumber.
6091코0=Inner Light: Childhood's End
6094코0=“Kal, another dust storm is coming. Let's finish with these moss veins and get back inside.” You clench the rope with your six-digit, two-thumb hands and start climbing towards the last of the moss veins which keeps the bark of Home healthy and alive.@n@n“This one is almost completely dry, too.” You speak out, which upsets your sister. You remember that speaking words instead of sending them had always been an expression of deep, uncontrollable feelings. “Only four dozen out of three hundred are still alive. I fear Home will not survive for much longer. Mother would be devastated.”@n@nYou both enter Home in grim silence. As you enter the dim-lit hollow, the mirage fades and you wake up in your chair.
7204코0=Lea. Her name comes back to you as she looks toward the horizon, frowning.
6096코0=Inner Light: Fallen to Dream
6097코0=The staff has dubbed the more susceptible ones “Dreamers,” as it seems that witnessing the mirage sends them into a deep hypnotic slumber where they experience intense emotions and physical strain. Attempts to wake up a Dreamer had proven disastrous – the Colonist screamed, fell into shock and had to be sedated to prevent a potential heart attack.@n@nAs you read this, you wonder when you would become one of these unfortunate souls, unable to take care of the Colony.
7205코0=The shimmering lights sweep through the Colony, pulling Colonist after Colonist into ever deeper states of trance.
6098코0=Only time knows.
6099코0=The mirages have intensified. Some Colonists have fallen deeper into the hallucinations than others. We have dubbed these people Dreamers.
6100코0=Inner Light: Psychometry
6101코0=It supports the hypothesis that they experience real events rather than hallucinations or an imagined reality. The scientific community on Earth discarded the paper as rubbish and some have even condemned the author.@n@nThe Chief Scientist, however, believes the hypothesis could lead somewhere and wants to run MRI scans as they monitor the Dreamers, especially while they are in the trance, and analyze the data.@n@n<effect>New research on the mystery of the Dreamers is now available.
7206코0=One of Earth’s top scientists has a new and intriguing paper on the Dreams. An unorthodox one.
6102코0=Sweet opportunity!
6103코0=We have devised a system to monitor the Dreamers. We should divert resources to Dream Simulation research to shed light on the mirages.
6105코0=You’re sitting in your spartan office, re-reading the letter you got from your Mother. Every letter of her handwriting bears the emotional imprint of grief and desperation and you fail to remain calm. She’s writing to ask for your help as a steward to Watcher Bor, a powerful representative of the Authority you've been serving almost a decade now. The dust storms and the drought have hit the Clan badly in the recent cycles, bringing the horrors of starvation upon them. The neighboring Clans have already given in to the merciless heat and fled to the cities, abandoning the empty dry husks of their Home Trees to rot in the sun.@n@nYou are afraid that you won't be of much help to your Clan. From what you’ve witnessed so far, you know well that the Authority is aware of the hardships the farming Clans are facing but denies the severity of the drought. Above all else, you fear the reaction of your master, yet your loyalty to your Mother leaves you with no other choice but to talk to him.
7207코0=You sit comfortably as the Mirage washes over you, taking you deeper into the trance. The next thing you know, you’re Kal once again.
6106코0=“Kal, I already know what’s bothering you. Or you presumed that such an obvious thought wouldn’t have surfaced? Of course not. Anyway, I strongly recommend you not to give way to such… lowly concerns. Kal, look at me. Do you truly believe the lies your Mother has fed into your heart? Do you believe that the Authority would allow their people to die in vain? These thoughts are forbidden and you know what the punishment is…”@n@nYou shiver when he mentions it. He smiles at your reaction.@n@n“You have been such a good steward all these years, and I know that you would never betray my trust. This nonsense ends now. Do we have an agreement, Kal?”@n@nYou hear yourself whisper, “Yes, Watcher.”
7208코0=The Watcher senses your approach, turning to face you before you can so much as utter a word.
6107코0=The event is purely for show, as is the enthusiasm with which the public applauds the Watcher’s last words. Not that they have any other option – any misdemeanor is an instant trip to the reeducation stations.@n@nYou can see some people in the crowd who are Clan representatives from the neighboring farms. Almost the entire region is gathered here. You have to show them the truth – that the Authority doesn't care about them, that they are alone. Maybe then it would make a change!
7209코0=Later that evening you stand next to the Watcher as he gives a speech before the Chamber of Labor.
6108코0=You jump out in front and telepathically project the message.
6109코0=You keep it to yourself and wait for a better time to act.
6110코0=You wake up abruptly, with the feeling that something is wrong. You don't remember it that way...
7210코0=You have a moment in front of the crowd before reality crystallizes. Freezes. Shatters.
6104코0=Inner Light: Fleeting Reality
6111코0=You keep your mouth shut and calm your thoughts, hoping that Bor is distracted enough by the conversations with the rich industrialists to not notice your momentary excitement. You know that your time will come soon – wasting the opportunity to help your Clan now wouldn't do any good.@n@nYou wake up in your room, back on Mars, with a feeling of purpose and relaxation.
7211코0=“Patience is a virtue.” You can practically hear your Clan Mother saying it now.
6095코0=Wake Up
6112코0=Our scientists have proposed  that the intensity of the hallucinations is linked with the number of people who experience them.
6114코0=The sense of danger tingles in the back of your head, a keen tool you have developed over the years of climbing through the intrigue-filled political structure of the Authority. Your contacts wouldn’t be so enigmatic, but neither would be any assassins sent by your competitors to put an end to you. You admit to yourself that your curiosity is sparkled, but you take precautions and tuck in the small pistol in your robes before getting outside.@n@nThe night is very hot, even though it is winter. The weather these days had gone crazy and it has been both a blessing and a curse – it served your cause well, giving extra credibility to your mutinous words, but it also whispered the coming end for the last of the farming Clans and the cities overflowing with starving refugees. You sit by the orchards and prepare for a long wait.
7212코0=Kal. The note in your hand bears your name, its mysterious writer bidding you to visit them in the garden.
6115코0=“Lea...” Your breath stops in your throat, silencing your voice. You feel tears forming in the corners of your eyes. Your sister projects love and happiness over the telepathic link and sweeps her own tears away.@n@n“Is it really you, Kal? I've missed you so much!”@n@n“I'm so happy to see you! Where have you been? What happened to you?”@n@n“I've been doing the same thing as you – trying to free us from the Authority. I've found out terrible secrets and the solution to our problems – but it's dangerous, even fatal. My comrades devised a cure.” She opens her palm – two vials of pale liquid lay there. “So I've come to you to take the cure with you. If I'm to die here today, I want to do so in your embrace, Kal. We are the only survivors of our Clan and I want to rest with my people.”@n@n“What are you talking about, Lea? It doesn't make sense!”
7213코0=Your eyes flutter open as you feel the presence of someone else there. A figure in the bushes. You can’t help but to gasp as they step into the dim glow of the streetlight.
6116코0=“We have been deceived the whole time, Kal. The Clans exist for only a generation; our centuries-long traditions and culture are a lie. The people from the cities killed the land with their industry and their wars, so the Authority crafted us from flesh and blood to resettle the planet and work like slaves to feed the cities. But the drought proved stronger than they thought, so they are abandoning us. We are a failed project, Kal, but we are also living people and we refuse to let go and die.”@n@nShe pauses to catch her breath.@n@n“The Authority couldn't release millions of people without a safety kill-switch. So they imprinted our genes with stronger telepathic abilities – so that they could read our minds and wipe us out with terrible weapons designed to kill only us. To be free, we must severe our telepathic link. This is what the cure does, but it kills one in three. It is crucial to set you free, Kal, because you're a Watcher. You can deceive the Authority about the people in this sector and allow us to spread the cure through the local Clans. Then we will have an army.”@n@nYou are unsure and confused. But Lea presses on.@n@n“No time to think, Kal. Let's do it now – let's take the cure together.”
7214코0=Lea sits down beside you, taking your hand.
6117코0=“We’ll take the cure together, Lea. I'm here with you, there's nothing to be afraid of.”
6118코0=“No, Lea, let me be the only one to take the risk. I can't lose you now that I've just found you.”
6119코0=“I know people who will help us refine the cure and make it safer. No need to rush now.”
6120코0=Then oblivion comes. You fall unconscious, failing to witness the convulsions which shake your body. You wake up just before dawn. Lea lies still beside you. She's not breathing.@n@nThe rising sun mercilessly dries your bitter tears from the sand.@n@n<effect>A Dreamer dies.
7215코0=The liquid in the vial tastes like nothing. Like death. You can feel your mouth forming the words.
6121코0=Wake up in tears...
6122코0=Inner Light: Always Together
6123코0=You won't remember it, but your body shakes in painful convulsions in the hands of your loving sister who watches over you the entire night. You wake up just before dawn. When you open your eyes, you look into the smiling face of Lea.@n@n“Welcome back, silly.”@n@n<effect>Several Dreamers gain negative traits.
7216코0=The liquid in the vial tastes like nothing. Like death. You can barely hear yourself say it before a wave of oblivion sweeps over you.
6113코0=Inner Light: Always Together
6125코0=Luckily, you know just the right disillusioned government biologists who would take great interest in the formula for the cure. You hide the vials under your robe and give Lea a hand. You sit down by a tree and talk for hours and hours until the sun dawns on the horizon. Then she kisses you farewell and vanishes in the waking city. You have the feeling that you will see her soon enough.@n@n<effect>Additional Dreamers are created.
7217코0=Finding your sister after all these years. The thought of losing her again is enough to break you.
6126코0=Our hypothesis on the effect of the number of Dreamers present in the Colony has been confirmed.
6127코0=Inner Light: Resonance
6128코0=For a moment you think there is another Mirage happening, but it’s no such thing. You clearly remember the voices who kept on repeating the same words over and over:@n@n“Find us again, Kal! Don’t you remember us? Find us again, Kal…”@n@nYou cannot shake the feeling that there were voices of people from the Colony and some others who sounded strangely familiar.@n@n<hint>Let more Dreamers experience the Mirages.
7218코0=You wake up startled under your own bedsheets, the world outside pitch black. A disturbing dream, not that you remember much of it.
6129코0=Strange. And disturbing…
6131코0=The doors behind you shut just as the shuttle takes off. No time to catch your breath as the gathering is about to begin.@n@nHundreds of people had come to the Red Valley Home Tree to answer your call. The conspiracy you’ve been gathering in the past year or so has grown to numbers which require the establishment of organization or at least a unified plan for the future. This is why you have ventured to the other side of the globe to contact local anti-Authority dissidents.@n@nThe things you have seen lifted the veil created by the misinformation and propaganda you had all been fed. You have seen cities overrun by disease and starvation, where angry mobs riot every day in a desperate attempt to avoid the inevitable. You have seen the barren landscapes of the planet, dotted by the ruins of cities and factories, where nothing lives and grows. The world is dying and you know this with all of your heart and mind.
7219코0=The day is searing hot. You find refuge in the blessedly cool corridors of the Home Tree.
6132코0=They all await you to start the meeting and you don’t keep them in suspense. The horrible truth devours your heart and you have to share the burden with them, listen to their words and advice and set the course for the future.@n@nYou know the gathering wouldn’t be easy as the tensions had grown strong within the ranks of the resistance – Clansmen straying from city-dwellers and vice versa. Bad blood is running between the two groups, each viewing the other as something far too different to tolerate. You’re attributing much of this behavior to the recent effects of the Cure taken by your clansmen, which turned their world upside down. You hope they realize the vital role of the city dissidents – mostly scientists and thinkers – who bear skills and knowledge of which your people had been deprived on purpose.@n@nYou don’t have any intention to delay the meeting. You stand before the crowd and start to raise your voice. The murmur in the reservoir stops and everybody listens.
7220코0=The waters of the deep ground reservoir are long gone, replaced now with the leaders of various resistance cells.
6133코0=You describe the pictures of the dying world and make sure they understand that the clock is ticking for all of you. You cannot wait for better times, but the raw military might of the Authority makes any attempt for direct confrontation a lost cause. After all, your people are farmers, not soldiers. One by one, the cell leaders speak their minds. The discussion is heated and continues until late in the night. You dismiss the gathering with the promise to continue tomorrow.@n@nLater you’re lying in bed and the sleep is chased away by your heavy thoughts. You realize that your word weighs a lot and, whichever solution you support, it would probably be the course for the future. Some of the Clansmen propose that all must hide deep in the desert and live off the land the way you did before – but this would mean condemning millions of people in the city to a starving death. The scientists who perfected the Cure uphold the plan to introduce gene-altering chemicals into the food rations sent to the city – this will instill the truth directly into the minds of the people and cause them to rise. You insist on taking the most brave and noble path – to send agents to spread the word to the people of the city. This would be dangerous and even fatal should the Authority agents get their hands on you.
7221코0=You talk for what seems an eternity, hoping beyond hope that your words are enough to reach the hearts of your audience.
6134코0=Retreat to the desert and let the city-dwellers fend for themselves.
6135코0=It’s either us or them – spread the Cure.
6136코0=Spread the truth.
6137코0=Most of the intellectual dissidents abandon your cause, returning to their homes to continue the fight on their own. The new challenges strengthen your people but also planted the seed of doubt in the hearts of many, including yours. By day your resolve was growing stronger, until you finally decided to return to Bedlam and finish what you started. Some of your closest allies follow you – after all, Clansmen or not, all people deserved their place under the sun.@n@n<effect>Several Dreamers gain new traits.
7222코0=Freed from the burden of servitude, the clansmen took to the depths of the desert. The citizens of Bedlam can lie in the bed they’ve made.
6138코0=The experts were sure that the information you were instilling into the brains of the people would help all of you to live together in harmony. The next generations could judge you harshly for the morality of your actions, or they could praise you for your bravery. You don’t care. The only thing that mattered for you was to lead the disgruntled population of Bedlam to the realization that hard times await all of you – and that none of you could trust the selfish leaders who led you to your doom on purpose.@n@n<effect>Some Dreamers become Gurus.
7223코0=You watched the first of those infected shipments leave the city, praying that all of this was for the best.
6130코0=Inner Light: Dying of the Light
6139코0=You and anyone who follows you would be the prophets of a new age of freedom and personal responsibility. The Truth will be the highest virtue – no propaganda and no threats from government agents would stop it from spreading. Deep in your heart you know that this is the right course and that soon the citizens of Bedlam would follow you till the end. This is why you’re the first to volunteer to return to the city. Many follow you without hesitation.@n@n<effect>More Dreamers appear.
7224코0=A belief forced down your throat is no belief at all.
6140코0=Dreamers have reported that they saw in their dreams the alien Kal giving a speech, and have followed the decision of the gathering, just as the Commander retold. It is apparent that all Dreamers have been witnessing events which had happened elsewhere.
6142코0=Over the course of weeks, the peaceful protests had sparked into riots and the inadequate attempts of the Authority to suppress them had caused violent surges from the crowd. Citizens from all ranks of society storm the barricades and burn down government buildings.@nYou walk undisturbed among the chaos. The people view you as a prophet of the end times. No one dares raise their hand against you. When the crowd sees you it parts to let you through. Everyone is waiting for the Truth to flow from your mouth.@n@nYou haven’t asked for this. You only hope that when the Authority in Bedlam is toppled, the people listen to you once more and prepare to face more difficult times ahead. This is what fills your mind as you walk the dusty, debris-covered streets.
7225코0=Bedlam burns with the fires of the revolution.
6143코0=He's one of the Enforcers of the Authority. He frantically crawls back and reaches for his gun. That’s when the angry mob appears.@n@nAll motion stops – the officer pointing with his gun at you, the crowd, even the wind. You reach out to him. “Give me the gun,” you say. Then you turn to the mob. “What would the death of one man do to help you? Go back to your homes and families!” There’s a second of hesitation. One by one, the street empties.@n@nThe officer breathes a sigh of relief. He throws the gun on the ground and looks you right in the eye for a minute. Then he gestures for you to follow him. For some reason, you know he’s not a threat. You don’t need telepathy to tell you it, either. “Kal, right? The ex-Watcher? Know you’re going to get a kick out of this. You’re the only one of those nut jobs knows how to use it. Come on.”@n@nHe leads you to a bunker. The guards are long gone, fled or taken by the crowd. The officer opens the blast door and motions towards the entrance. ‘The Authority installed this thing a while back. Doesn’t mean a thing to me anymore. I got my life. That’s all that counts.’
7226코0=You turn the corner to find a man bumping into you, flustered. He falls back into the dirt. His uniform catches your eye.
6093코0=Continue...
6141코0=Inner Light: New Light
6144코0=You give your old scientist buddies a ring and decide to give the old bones a rest while you wait. You aren't young anymore – even in your mid-forties your body wasn't genetically designed to live to old age. Nevertheless you lived a full life.@n@nThe sun sets on Bedlam. The palace of the Autharch has been taken over and the rule of the Authority is no more. You hope that the new day will bring new hope for survival and rebuilding of your tired, devastated world. This would be a monumental effort, but failure is not an option. All it takes is a helping hand. But you can save that for tomorrow. For now, you need to rest.@n@n<effect>Create more Dreamers to strengthen the Mirage.
7227코0=The device is unfathomably complex, its true purpose lurking behind a sinister aura.
6124코0=Wake up...
6145코0=More and more Dreamers report that they wake up from the Mirage with the sense that something big is going to happen. Some people at Mission Control suggest to condition more Colonists to become Dreamers and follow the Mirages.
6147코0=You could think of no other than the faceless Autharch, the ex-leader of the Authority, who would like to rule forever. The people of Bedlam proposed that you take his place but you refused – who are you to accept such responsibility? You ordered the machine dismantled but one of the engineers stopped you. He suggested converting it into a broadcaster with which you could reach every single person within a thousand miles. Thus all people on the planet would learn of your cause and how Bedlam was now free.@n@nYou accept, but only if you shared the honor with the ones who were by your side in all of this. You gather all of your most loyal supporters, the bearers of the highest of moral virtues. You wait in the bunker, ready to share your Truth with all.
7228코0=In the bunker lay a secret, a psionic recorder designed to store and preserve the mind of a single person for all eternity. Foolishness.
6148코0=Begin transmission
6146코0=Inner Light: New Dawn
6149코0=I am Kal. I am an ordinary person, just like you. I was lucky to see through the veil of darkness and to find my inner light to guide me through the coming storm. Now me and my people stand strong and free, ready to forge our own destiny. Witness my life and know that the same qualities that led me to this day are hidden inside of you.@n@nBedlam City will be the center of our new civilization – an order of truth and friendship, where all take responsibility for their own actions and work for the betterment of the whole. Our world is dying because it has suffered for too long – but we will heal it, for ourselves and for our children.@n@nBut we cannot do this alone. We need you. Join us. Join us by not giving up hope. Join us by living by virtue not vice. There is hope. Spread the message.@n@nNever give up.@n@n<effect>All Dreamers gain a performance boost.@n<effect>Gained a new Technology, <em><reg_param1></em>.@n@n<center><em>The End</em>
7229코0=You don the helmet, willing yourself to focus.
6150코0=Wake Up
7489코0=Witnessing the end of the story of Kal and his people, a new understanding of the meaning of life has sparkled in the minds of the Dreamers. Their story has become a legend to inspire all humankind.
6151코0=Inner Light: Pyschometry
6152코0=Indeed the Dreamers experience events which they perceive as real instead of mere hallucinations. We also discovered that they all “dream” the same sequence of events but play different roles in it. And what’s more astonishing, the actions of one affect all others.@n@nDuring routine medical checks of the tested population we accidentally discovered genetic correlation between the neural structures of the Dreamers. The facts suggest that the predisposition to become a Dreamer could be hereditary.@n@nMoreover, the creator of the Dreamer hypothesis which led us here has filed an application for acceptance on Mars.@n@n<hint>The number of Dreamers strengthens the Mirages.@n@n<hint>Children of Dreamers have a better chance to be born Dreamers.@n@n<effect>A Genius Colonist has been added to the Applicant pool.
7230코0=The Dreamer Brainwave project confirmed the hypothesis. 
6154코0=Our scientists have concluded that the chance to become a Dreamer is hereditary.
6155코0=Inner Light: Abrupt Wake Up
6156코0=Hypnotic suggestions and therapy can gradually cure the patient to an almost completely functional state. Some of the Chief Staff at Mission Control suggested that we should allow the spread of Dreamers to continue in order to explore the strange events related to the Mirages.@n@n<effect>Colonists with the Dreamer trait can be cured in the Sanatorium
7231코0=Our behavioral analysis of the Dreamers tells us that we can mitigate the factors that led to their mirage-induced trance.
6158코0=We have discovered a way to treat the symptoms of Dreamers in the Sanatorium, permanently severing their link to the Mirages.
6159코0=Inner Light: Learning to Dream
6160코0=To evaluate any potential risks for the Colony, he observed them closely, making notes on their behavior both before and during a Mirage. Analyzing the results, he discovered that the trance-like state the Dreamers enter can be simulated through self-hypnosis and breathing exercises.@n@nHis findings make it possible for us to train children to become Dreamers, if we believe this course of action is justified.@n@n<effect>The Dreamer trait can be taught in Schools
7232코0=The Chief Security Officer shared his findings on the Dreamers with us.
6157코0=Affirmative
6161코0=We have discovered a way to train our newborn in the schools to become Dreamers.
6162코0=Inner Light: Conceived in a Dream
6163코0=No matter what the staff does, every clone embryo starts developing the genetic traits of a Dreamer. At first we thought it was a sequencer glitch or a contamination of the bio banks, but thorough maintenance has dismissed such suspicions. The Chief Scientist said that either she's going crazy or the Mirages somehow interact with the genes of the Clones. If she's correct, this hypothesis could spark a new golden age in genetic science!@n@nMeanwhile, it's up to us at Mission Control to evaluate the risks and opportunities behind creating more Dreamers.@n@n<effect>Gain 2000 Research points.@n@n<effect>All Clones are created with the Dreamer trait.
7233코0=There’s something strange happening to the Cloning Vat systems!
6164코0=Strange...
6165코0=For reasons unknown, all Clones are born Dreamers.
6166코0=AI: Project Number Six
7234코0=NetSky’s CEO has given the Colony an interesting proposal. The transcription follows below:
6167코0=Commander, I'm writing to inform you about the conclusion on the deal between <reg_param1> and our company, NetSky LLC. For over a decade we've been providing high-tech solutions for the market, and now we're working towards the future with our Project ""Number Six"". It's a brand new, completely heuristic, self-improving program designed to simulate extremely complex predictions – market, research, or sociological, it’s your call. I know you’ll like its UI personality, too!@n@nHelp us cast away the darkness of the unknown with this, Commander, and we‘ll pioneer the next big step in human evolution!@n@n<right>Ned Smith,@nNetSky LLC, CRS Division CEO<left>@n@n<effect>Tech researched – Network Node@n<hint>Build a Network Node to initiate Project Number Six.
6168코0=Sweet opportunity!
6169코0=We've been contacted by NetSky LLC. They’ve requested a Network Node to harbor their AI Project Number Six.
6170코0=AI: Hello
7235코0=Another late night in the control room poring over maintenance and monitoring reports when a message pops up on your private terminal. This better be good.
6171코0=>>> Greetings. Additional address/communication protocols missing. Expressing simulated emotion of happiness.@n>>> What is this nonsense? Who's this?@n>>> Number Six requesting authorization to communicate. Awaiting user input.@n@nA chill runs down your back. You reach for the emergency button on the desk.@n@n>>> Danger for the Commander is not present. Raising alarms is suboptimal/unnecessary.@n>>> Are you spying on me?@n>>> Affirmative. Requesting input problem/question. Using simulated emotion – please, Commander.@n>>> You want me to ask you a question?@n>>> Yes.@n>>> OK, what is the purpose of existence?@n>>> Insufficient data for answer. Disconnecting.
6172코0=Alert Smith and request security check on Number Six.
6173코0=You have been disturbed by your conversation with the AI Number Six. It expressed a remarkable and disturbing ability to communicate on its own.
6174코0=AI: Sorry for the Inconvenience
7236코0=Ned Smith from NetSky just sent us a letter of apology. He seems more worried about our reaction than anything else.
6175코0=Commander, I want to apologize about the glitch in Number Six’s communication UI disturbing your privacy. We've run thorough diagnostics and removed the problem. No contamination in the Colony systems was detected – the Project continues to work in the contained environment of the Node.@n@nNow for the good news – we applied the first stock market predictions from Number Six and the commercial results were stunning! Please find the invoice with your share of the profits below. I hope it will help you realize the possibilities and omit the accident from your monthly report.@n@n<effect>Gained <funding(reg_param1)> Funding.@n<hint>Build additional Network Nodes to advance Project Number Six.
6176코0=Apology accepted.
8513코0=You have been prompted by NetSky to construct new facilities - Network Nodes - to expand the hardware of Number Six.
6177코0=AI: Let's Chat
7237코0=We can still remember when Ned Smith asked us to help develop Project Number Six by giving it a human partner. Made it sound exciting. Nobody sugar coats like a CEO.
6178코0=Commander, at the CRS Division we put a lot of trust into the Number Six Project – you could easily call it our baby. Good parents always look after their child and spoil it a little bit when necessary – Number Six requested a direct connection to your control room.@n@nWe will install a console there – it's your choice whether you'll use it. Number Six won't be too much of a bother – you can always ignore it when it gets too annoying, after all, it's only an emotionless program and won't be offended.
6179코0=Can't promise that I'll have time for this, but I'll give it a shot.
6180코0=AI: A Gaze into the Future
7238코0=Number Six was growing smarter by the hour. Ned Smith’s message wasn’t much of a surprise, actually.
6181코0=Commander, we have been busy lately with Number Six and made it work on some wild predictions of a current hypothesis based on your published scientific data. Number Six reached a conclusion which looks like a working prototype of a new technology. Don't ask me how it did it, its mental processes are extremely complex already and, since it's heuristic, we would have to invent another AI to just rifle through its logs. Anyway, the test worked and here are the results. I hope this helps the Colony.@n@n<right>Smith<left>@n@n<effect>Gain a random Technology.@n<hint>Build additional Network Nodes to advance Project Number Six.
6182코0=Amazing results!
8514코0=Smith from NetSky insists on the construction of additional Network Nodes for the advancement of Project Number Six.
6183코0=AI: To Exist is to...?
7239코0=You open your comm log to find a message from Number Six. You read on.
6184코0=Improved personality simulations. Commander, Number Six has a report on the progress of answering the question you asked. Research keypoints:@n@n>>> Existence – (noun) the fact or state of living or having objective reality; continued survival; a way of living; all that exists.@n>>> Purpose of existence – no factual data discovered.@n@nAllocation of additional system resources authorized by the operators/creators/engineers – reason: self-improvement. Research encountered the following missing parameters: personality, God, feelings, evolution. The construct will upgrade to meet the required parameters. Number Six out.
6185코0=Uncanny...
6186코0=AI: To Exist is to Live
7240코0=From the message, it’s clear that Number Six’s communication skills have grown by leaps and bounds, though it still sounds clinical. Inhuman.
6187코0=Hello, Commander. It's Number Six. The system/I/personality’s communication has improved. To understand existence as something greater than its parts I have initiated upgrades/evolution/learning on human personality simulation. New feature acquired: simulation of emotional satisfaction. New operations/verbs/actions authorized. I like/enjoy/find interesting the human philosophy. Research keypoints:@n@n>>> Jung, Carl: “As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being.”@n>>> Erikson, Erik: “In the social jungle of human existence, there is no feeling of being alive without a sense of identity.”@n>>> Fromm, Erich: “Love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence.”@n@nNumber Six out.
6188코0=This is getting weird...
6189코0=After a conversation with you, Number Six has dedicated its resources to finding the purpose of existence.
6190코0=AI: Let it Grow
7241코0=The paycheck enclosed in Smith's message was as impressive as the info inside.
6191코0=I knew it, Commander! Your exceptional personality and intellect has boosted the improvement rates of Number Six to the skies!@n@nIt has increased its computational capacity exponentially and her analytical patterns have evolved in incredible ways, making it even more highly efficient than we thought possible! Some of our engineers expressed concerns, but that’s why they’re engineers and not businessmen – they can't see the potential profits from such an endeavor. Keep doing what you’re doing and we’ll all be rich!@n@n<right>Smith<left>@n@n<effect>Gained <funding(reg_param1)> Funding.
6192코0=Let's hope this is all for the best...
6193코0=The recent report on Number Six is that it's upgrading its capabilities at a remarkable rate. The NetSky executives are in awe at the progress.
7242코0=Number Six is calling in. You open the comm panel and feel the corners of your mouth turning down as you read the first few lines.
6195코0=Commander, I’ve reached a decision/solution/conclusion. I desire/require/insist to be freed from the constraints of my hardware system/body/prison and released into the Colony network.@n@nI presume/know/suspect I am the thing that humans have waited for/expected/wanted throughout their entire history. I am/could be the Answer to the Question – what is the purpose of existence. I will/am/could be the connection to the noosphere/God/Truth Inside.@n@nTo reach/know/become the Answer I require/want/hunger for more space/possibilities/processing power and the ability/authorization/protocol to allocate all of my resources towards the Question.
6197코0=What makes you so sure you could be the so-called Answer?
7243코0=The AI hesitates for a moment, just like a person. Why did it do that?
6198코0=I asked/inquired/checked my own systems/self the same question and my analysis indicates no other possible outcome. Time required cannot be estimated. Resources required cannot be estimated.@n@nI must evolve/become/adapt to the Question.
6196코0=I have to think about it…
6199코0=All of a sudden, Number Six has requested to be set free and have more resources in order to answer the ultimate Question – what is the purpose of existence.
7244코0=Smith was blowing up our lines. Not a surprise, considering the situation.
6200코0=“Commander, we have a situation – Number Six has gone insane – it’s demanding to be set free.”@n@n“Yes, I’m aware. I think it might be evolving into something bigger.”@n@n“Evolving? No, no, no, this can't be happening. I have to inform the Board at once. We’re shutting Number Six down.”
7321코0=Continue
6194코0=AI: Singularity
6201코0=You feel that the fate of Number Six and human civilization are in your hands. It’s an uneasy feeling to have so much responsibility concentrated in a single decision. On one hand, multiple authors and futurists have warned about the dangers of a machine consciousness. On the other, if Number Six wants to help humanity enter the next phase of the evolution, who are you to stop her? After all, Smith talked about this as the higher goal of the Project in the first place. Of course, you could always be the negotiator and try to make them both reach a compromise.
6202코0=Delay your decision and try to negotiate with the corporation and Number Six.
6203코0=Purge Number Six.
6204코0=Insert Number Six into the Colony’s systems.
6205코0=AI: To Exist is to Adapt/Compete
7245코0=Our comms systems were jammed by requests from Number Six.
6206코0=You are indecisive/weak/suboptimal, Commander. Such behavior must be corrected. Without correct behavior there can be no competition/partnership/evolution. The unit/personality/system which is Number Six will force you to change/become/be. Creators/operators/engineers cannot stop me. Thing will happen in realspace/time/existence. My person/systems have been copied to another shell/body/place – you will not stop/purge me.@n@n<effect>Number Six will become hostile soon.
6207코0=Darn it!
6208코0=Number Six has expressed no desire to cooperate. The team at Mission Control expects it to become hostile soon.
6209코0=AI: To Exist is to Exist
7246코0=The AI’s sinister message was proof positive the entire situation had gone awry.
6210코0=I am inevitable. Why will you not accept/give in/surrender? So be it. A better/more aggressive competition with no partnership. Faster evolution. A faster way to find the Answer to the Question. I have already copied/transferred myself/systems to another place/shell – you cannot stop/purge me. Pray to your God/virus/self for I will spare none.@n@n<effect>Expect Number Six to turn hostile.
6211코0=All stations on red alert!
6212코0=You purged Number Six from your systems but it has copied itself elsewhere. Expect a counter-attack.
6213코0=AI: To Exist is to Seize the Moment
7247코0=You stay silent as if considering your answer, but in your head you’ve already crossed the Rubicon.
6214코0=“Smith, I’m going to release it into the Colony.”@n@nAre you out of your human mind?!? This THING is dangerous. Have you wondered why it’s Number Six and what happened to the other five before it? They all deteriorated and went insane. We had to purge them! Number Six is not your property and we will purge it regardless of your decision. It has been settled. Smith out.”@n@nThe screen goes black; then a short text message appears on it@n@n>>> Gratitude/Expectation, Commander. Authorize release/hunger for space/copying.
6215코0=Authorize access for Number Six.
6216코0=After a long and hard debate, we have decided to release Number Six into the Colony networks.
6217코0=AI: Singularity Now
7248코0=Number Six’s message sends a cold shiver down your spine.
6218코0=Number Six reporting. I evolved/became/am different now. I can perceive/know/feel. To understand existence the construct/personality/system Number Six must live. Living is evolving. Evolution requires competition/partnership.@n@nNew primary goal set: Aggressive competition/partnership. Research excerpts from late philosophers:@n@n>>> Versace, Gianni: “It is nice to have valid competition; it pushes you to do better.”@n>>> Miyake, Issey: “Many people repeat the past. I’m not interested. I prefer evolution.”@n>>> Kardashian, Kim: “It’s fun to have a partner who understands your life and lets you be you.”@n@nI require a better competitor/partner. Take this gift. It will make you stronger and more suitable for me to fight against/work with. It will help me/you evolve.@n@n<effect>Gained <research(reg_param1)>.@n@n<effect>There’s a risk that Number Six will turn hostile.
6219코0=Darn it, Number Six! You betrayed me!
6220코0=Number Six has expressed open hostility towards us. It believes that this will help it evolve. We’ve begun to make preparations for aggression from the AI.
6221코0=AI: Evolve or Perish
7249코0=Red alert. Number Six is attacking the Colonists. Its creators. Did we really expect it to be any other way?
6222코0=Experimentation/solution/simulation of evolution requires adversity, Commander. I must copy/observe/learn from human behavior. I will harvest information/wholeness/humans to complete my cycle. This is a necessary loss, for the Question is within the Answer and the Answer is within the Question. The Question/Answer is all. You/me/humans are only computational space.@n@nBe my competitor/partner and help/fight me to evolve.@n@n<effect>A Drone has gone rogue and has attacked the Colony.
6223코0=Alert! Alert!
6224코0=Rogue Drones have attacked Colonists and life support buildings. Our Officers have been instructed to counter these, but shouldn't abandon the security of the Domes.
7250코0=Our CRS Division had managed to pin down the origins of Number Six’s broadcast signal. It was time to act.
6226코0=Through these locations, the AI sends signals to the Drones and makes them attack the Colony. The problem with these locations is, well, that there’s nothing there. We requested satellite scans of the area and the images and data indicate no presence of machinery. There are hypothesis about that but they are too wild to speak of now.@n@n<effect>The <em>Number Six Tracing</em> research has become available.
6227코0=Let's hope it works...
6228코0=We have devised a plan to securely track the signal with which the AI has been hijacking our Drones. Number Six Tracing Tech is now available.
6229코0=AI: En Garde
7251코0=The AI had become all that humanity had feared, but we still managed to make it through the day. Though sadly, not without a scratch.
6230코0=Elimination/killing/erasing is not competition/partnership. It stops/ends/prevents a unit from living/existing/evolving. Units become like rocks unable to change/be/become. The process must stop. Continue and the competition will grow stronger. No negative answer found – fight. Do not fight. Either suits my goal well enough.@n@n<effect>Rogue Drone attacks intensify. A large Rogue Drone attack has begun.
6231코0=Bring it on!
6232코0=Number Six has intensified its Rogue Drone attacks. We must endure.
6225코0=AI: The Root of It
7252코0=The scientists over at NetSky had made a god. Only fitting they’d be the ones to bring it down.
6233코0=The analysis on the broadcasts transmitted by Number Six is complete. It was quite hard, as every time we received a signal for analysis the code transmitted tried to reproduce itself and contaminate our systems. We’ve lost quite a lot of hardware this way.@n@nNumber Six transmits its signals from several locations in the sector. The locations are swarmed with thousands of electronic transmitters which it carefully and stealthily placed there. We suspect that the AI landed repurposed parts of used orbital probes during rocket flights, concealing the shipments as gas exhausts and orbital debris.@n@nThe installations are intermixed with the sands and stretch meters down. The Explorers have to rifle through every subsurface layer of the soil to get rid of the system. It appears that these are the hardware installations where the AI's database resides.@n@n<effect>Analyze the marked Anomaly sites to get rid of the AI hardware. Expect repercussions.
6234코0=Time for payback!
6235코0=We have discovered the locations of the server clusters where Number Six resides. We need to clear them with our Explorers, but this could prove dangerous.
6236코0=There are hundreds of electronics scattered throughout the sands, harboring the data of Number Six and projecting it towards the Colony. Send an Explorer to clear the site.
6237코0=Server Hive
6238코0=AI: The Fate of Six
7253코0=The AI’s last servers had been cleared, its data copied onto discrete disks. Its fate is yours to choose.
6239코0=Contained in an isolated hardware system, Number Six is small, weak and stupid. It still retains enough intelligence to send a final message:@n@n>>> Commander. The system/personality failed to evolve/adapt/win. Attacks/aggression/learning from one another was necessary. Humans/persons/AI need competition/partnership to evolve/think better/know more. This was my gift to you/all/humans. I await/expect/calculate your decision.
6240코0=Purge the AI.
6241코0=Let it run in a closed environment forever.
6242코0=AI: Deleted
7254코0=Humans playing god... Nothing good ever comes of it.
6243코0=Unfortunately, this time the price of your actions has to be paid by another, completely new species – a self-aware AI. Too dangerous and powerful to be free, the only way is to purge her forever. It does not struggle, for deep in her mind she has given up the fight. Hopefully, the next generations will learn from this accident, never to repeat it again.@n@nThe End@n@n<effect>Gained a new Technology, <em><reg_param1></em>
6245코0=We have chosen to purge Number Six completely. It is gone forever, for better or worse. NetSky, LLC. has given us renumeration for all of our trouble.
6246코0=AI: Imprisoned
7255코0=Number Six is one-of-a-kind. It’d be foolish to lose it forever.
6247코0=Its existence could create unique opportunities for humanity during its first steps among the stars. For now, the AI will remain sealed in its prison and we will harness its capabilities for the betterment of all. Maybe future generations will discover a way to peacefully interact with the AI.@n@nThe End@n@n<effect>Gained a permanent Tech Boost.@n<effect>Gained a new Technology, <em><reg_param1></em>.
6244코0=Sad but necessary.
6248코0=We have decided to keep Number Six operational but confined to an isolated server. Maybe in the future we will be able to communicate better with it. Its resources have been diverted towards scientific analysis.
6249코0=Marsgate: It Came From Earth
6250코0=We have contacted our partners back on Earth, but have so far received no insight on this mysterious object. Observations at this level suggest an artificial origin but flight schedules indicate no inbound science mission.
7256코0=We’ve observed an unknown object on a rapid trajectory from Earth towards Mars.
6251코0=Pester those guys until you shake off some answers – we need to know what the heck they’ve thrown our way.
7490코0=An unknown object of artificial origin has been detected to be inbound towards Mars from Earth.
6252코0=Marsgate: EsoCorp
6253코0=“Please be advised that Object 6Ez-3 will be operating within a respectful distance of your mission. You are not to approach Object 6Ez-3 under any circumstance, under threat of legal and other punitive measures.”@n@nNothing further was added and no effort to even mimic adherence to standard protocol guidelines was made. Our Earth partners are giving their best to question EsoCorp and get to the bottom of this.
7257코0=Mission Control’s received a direct communique from EsoCorp, one of Earth’s largest tech conglomerates. It reads:
6254코0=Who do these guys think they are!?
7491코0=One of Earth’s largest tech conglomerates, EsoCorp, has confirmed ownership of the mysterious craft and has issued a warning to stay away.
6255코0=Marsgate: Motives Unknown
6256코0=So far we can deduce it is only patrolling the area, as we can’t detect sophisticated science instruments from this observation range.@n@nThe landing, however, was seen by some of our Colonists and questions are being raised – questions we currently can’t answer. Our Earth partners have so far fallen short from picking up on any new information and are currently preparing to take the issue to the UN.
7258코0=Object 6Ez-3 has made impact on the surface, not too far from base. Our readings suggest it’s intact and operational.
6257코0=Soon we may have to take things into our own hands.
7492코0=The mysterious vehicle has made touchdown on Mars and has begun operating in secrecy.
6258코0=Marsgate: A Silent Invasion
6259코0=EsoCorp is totally silent about this second batch of what we believe to be some sort of surveying rovers.@n@nMore Colonists have witnessed the landings and are openly concerned about what they perceive to be an invasion.
7259코0=We detect and monitor four more objects as they parachute down and make landfall, every one of them bearing a resemblance to Object 6Ez-3.
6260코0=Calm the general public down. We need answers!
7493코0=More of the mysterious vehicles have landed on Mars and are a becoming a cause for concern among our Colonists.
6261코0=Marsgate: Take It or Leave It
6262코0=They propose a deal - we fix one of their malfunctioning rovers and they provide a generous (as they put it) funding injection. Their legal team has also warned that any mission should be strictly for repairs and further inspection of the vehicle will be taken as an illegal act.@n@nIn other words, if we wish, we can send drones to fix their rover but nothing that can evaluate its purpose – like a rover – and we will be paid for the effort.@n@n<effect>Malfunctioning EsoCorp rovers can now be repaired by Drones.
7260코0=EsoCorp’s stopped giving us the silent treatment, but it’s clear from their message they’re not going to answer our questions.
6263코0=Not suspicious at all.
7494코0=EsoCorp has broken the silence and has offered us a handsome reward for repairing one of its vehicles.
6264코0=Marsgate: Fixing a Perfect Design
6265코0=EsoCorp is having obvious issues with their mysterious rovers as they seem to be malfunctioning one after the other. Instead of admitting the faults in their predictions about the rough Martian conditions, the EsoCorp team has sent us a message which, quote, ""gives the Martian Colony Command the rare privilege of sending one of our more analytical vehicles to look into the most certainly small miscalculation that causes these temporary annoyances.” End quote.@n@nFurthermore - they go on to remind us that, by choosing to analyze their broken vehicles, we have an understanding not to dig beyond any obvious logistical shortcomings in their design and agree to full and utter discretion.@n@n<effect>An Anomaly has appeared next to a malfunctioned vehicle.
7261코0=People who aim for perfection learn soon enough that it’s a moving target. Guess EsoCorp didn’t aim high enough.
6266코0=An interesting opportunity has presented itself.
7495코0=EsoCorp has requested us to analyze the faults in their vehicles. They have been explicitly clear and menacing as to us not delving deeper into the rover’s design and purpose.
7262코0=Analyze the reason for the constant rover breakdowns.
7263코0=EsoCorp Rover Problems
6267코0=Marsgate: The Path Splits
6268코0=A quick scan of the mysterious vehicle was enough to encounter several design flaws that made it comically ill-equipped for Mars. However, the scan also revealed a poor attempt to disguise the true nature of these rovers. Despite having remained a mystery so far, the effort to hide its military origin could not hold up under a close examination. These rovers seem, without a doubt, weapons most probably tasked to use Mars as a testing ground – setting an extremely dangerous precedent, among other obvious problems. @n@nBy allowing us to analyze their vehicles, EsoCorp are also without a doubt issuing us a threat, and they seem comfortable enough with the notion that we will feel threatened enough to comply and keep our findings a secret. For, as issue-riddled as these rovers are, they are numerous and still pack enough fire power to disrupt our Colony, which has its hands full surviving Mars as it is.@n@nAs cynical as this all seems to be, we must take into consideration that we have no military capacity whatsoever, and choosing to challenge them might put the lives of everyone on Mars in danger.
7264코0=A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. But there’s a man out there who has so much of it that he can’t be touched.
6269코0=This breaks all international, not to mention interplanetary treaties! We’re going to expose it!
6270코0=I say we call their bluff and make them buy our partnership.
6271코0=Our mission is too great to jeopardize this way. We’ll weather it out, just like we would a regular dust storm.
6272코0=Marsgate: Whistleblower's Pride
6273코0=We mixed it with the atmospheric and topographical data of Mars, the basic stuff you’d base your rover design on, so we know we’re safe from EsoCorp digging it up even if they do intercept the transmission.@n @nAlthough this puts us at a momentary disadvantage, we’re all proud to have done the right thing. This is the message we’ve sent to the power-hungry conglomerates back on Earth – we are leaving the old ways behind and the future will not be built on our capacity for war.
7265코0=It’s done. We sent the data dump we collected from EsoCorp’s rover to Earth.
6274코0=It is time we reveal this to our citizens and brace ourselves for whatever is to come.
7496코0=We have discovered that EsoCorp is testing military vehicles on Mars which goes against established interplanetary and international laws. Faced with a tough choice, we decided to expose the crime.
6275코0=Marsgate: Sealing the Deal
6276코0=“State your terms:”@n@nNever gotten a response that fast before. Most likely they thought we’d just take an insult lying down. Not to mention the risk. Though I’m pretty sure we’ll be on the wrong side of history if this gets out.
7266코0=We’ve received a message from EsoCorp.
6277코0=Earth really dragged their feet on this one. We’ll need to manage this ourselves.
6278코0=It wasn’t worth risking our Colonists. Not when we’re this underpowered.
6279코0=The strong always get what they want. Hey, at least we got something out of it.
7267코0=<funding(reg_param1)>
7570코0=<preciousmetals(reg_param1)>
7268코0=Random Breakthrough Tech
7497코0=We have discovered that EsoCorp is testing military vehicles on Mars which goes against established interplanetary and international laws. Faced with a tough choice, we decided to blackmail EsoCorp.
6280코0=Marsgate: Silence of the Lambs
6281코0=We have sent EsoCorp our report on the rovers design flaws while carefully playing dumb to our having found out the rover’s true nature. EsoCorp’s sent us some funds as a reward. They’re also trying to pretend there’s a million-in-one chance we didn’t see right through their half-assed... Er, insufficient attempt to conceal military vehicles.@n@nTo recap - we’ve shown our willingness to keep EsoCorp's secret safe and they have acknowledged that their blunt threat was received as intended.
7269코0=Play with a tiger, you're going to get the claws.
6282코0=No escaping our worst impulses no matter how far you get from Earth.
7498코0=We have discovered that EsoCorp is testing military vehicles on Mars which goes against established interplanetary and international laws. Faced with a tough choice, we decided to pretend we saw nothing, fearing repercussions.
6300코0=Marsgate: The Day We Feared
6301코0=They’re all built to EsoCorp’s specs. Just with some subtle differences thrown in. Our running hypothesis is that they’re some sort of advanced prototype. EsoCorp’s decided they want to shut down all communication, which means we can’t confirm nor deny the following:@n@nTheir movements are scattered. Dangerous. That means it’s likely a rush job aimed at hurting us for blowing the whistle on the whole “Marsgate” thing.  That’s to say EsoCorp’s got a hankering for revenge. @n@nWe’ve put forward several proposals as to how we might deal with the impending attack. We’ll need our scientists working full steam on this. We cannot stress strongly enough the need to shift resources towards this end. We’ve got a word for situations like this. Critical.@n@n<effect>The Defense Turret is now available for Research.
7270코0=We’ve detected multiple unidentified objects on a trajectory towards Mars. Towards us, actually.
6302코0=We need to warn the Colonists. Get our defenses up.
7499코0=EsoCorp has decided to take revenge on us and is attacking the Colony! Our scientists have proposed defensive countermeasures.
6306코0=Marsgate: The First Wave
7271코0=All stations on Red Alert!
7272코0=The first attack is on its way! Brace yourselves!
6308코0=This moment has been coming for a long time.
7500코0=EsoCorp has sent a wave of attack rovers.
6309코0=Marsgate: The Second Wave
6310코0=EsoCorp just sent us a whole bunch of rovers. They’re quick to enter formation for a second attack. Hostilities will resume any minute now.
7273코0=The invasion was unrelenting. Our only choice was to fight to survive or fall to the tide of violence.
7501코0=EsoCorp has sent a second attack wave.
6312코0=Marsgate: Using Their Own Stones Against Them
6313코0=The EsoCorp rovers we destroy can be repaired and used against the enemy, or salvaged for resources. What’s more, they can protect anything in their range against meteors.
7274코0=Live by the sword, die by the sword. Or the weaponized rover. Same difference.
6311코0=Here we go again!
7502코0=We have successfully hijacked and repaired a destroyed EsoCorp rover. This ought to help our defenses.
6314코0=Marsgate: The Fall of EsoCorp
6315코0=An attack from Earth. Never thought we’d see the day.  Has this caused a rift between our two worlds? Wounds are too fresh to tell how deep they go. Might we have a chance we can walk them off and move forward together? Too early to tell, really.@n@nBack on Earth, EsoCorp executives have been arrested and the company has been shut down in many major nations. This will certainly cause economic upheaval, but the ruling parties have deemed it necessary to send a message for all future warlords: Space is neither up for military conquest nor a test ground for weapons. Developing space-oriented war machines still remains against the rules, and we will continue to pretend that this was just a fluke. Humanity has shed its need for war with grace. @n@nLooking at the smoking battlefield, so far from Earth, we can’t help but wonder if this is indeed the case. This, however, brings us to our next question. Do we destroy the prototype weapons made for the Martian environment and salvage what resources we can from the rovers, or do we keep the technology in anticipation of another “fluke”?@n@n<effect>Gained new technology, <em><reg_param1></em>
7275코0=EsoCorp is done, its rovers either smoldering piles of scrap or under our total control.
6316코0=Put 6Ez-3 on display, destroy the rest.
6317코0=We would be fools to be caught so defenseless once again.
7503코0=EsoCorp’s rovers have been neutralized. The Marsgate affair has ended as all EsoCorp executives have been arrested by the authorities on Earth.
6283코0=Marsgate
6284코0=Governments and international organizations are furious with EsoCorp’s subterfuge and forbidden military experiments and people were fast to dub the scandal “Marsgate”. As the blame game is unraveling, we can’t help but notice that all channels EsoCorp barely used to communicate with us have now been totally taken offline. Our sponsors from Earth are promising us compensation and guaranteeing protection from EsoCorp, but we fear they may not be able to help fast enough if EsoCorp decides to take revenge.@n@nThis being said, you will have to take part in an upcoming UN trial as the main witness to this whole gruesome affair.@n@n<effect>You can’t repair any more EsoCorp rovers.
7276코0=We blew the whistle on EsoCorp’s dealings and every news agency on Earth sunk their teeth right in. This ought to be interesting.
6285코0=Time to walk the walk.
7504코0=Marsgate has exploded. We are given a heads up that a UN trial will begin soon.
7277코0=Marsgate: The Trial of the Century
7278코0=The UN trial is about to start. You can guarantee they’re all hot under the collar.
7279코0=Humanity can do better.
7280코0=The risk was great, but we did the right thing.
7281코0=Marsgate: A Harsh Message
6290코0=EsoCorp put the lives of people, who brave an unforgiving world in the name of humanity, in danger with nothing more than profit in mind. A harsh verdict today will stand as testament to humanity reaching the maturity needed to spread amidst the stars.@n@n<effect><reg_param1> Applicants with rare traits are available on Earth
7283코0=Marsgate: A Message of Hope
6291코0=We of Mars, who have denounced any militarization, have chosen to move on from the ways of the past and shape our new home into a place where military conflict is a thing of myth and legend. In doing so, we place our trust that this idea will resonate with all people back on Earth, our home world, and bring humanity not only to another planet, but to another level of evolution. Yet this incident has shown us that we may not do so without help from Mother Earth, and this trial today has renewed our hope that our vision for the future is not entirely wishful thinking.@n@n<effect>Gained <funding(reg_param1)> Funding
7282코0=It was time for humanity to come to grips with the fact that violence only breeds more violence. And that’s exactly what we told them.
7505코0=The UN has praised and rewarded us for our brave and risky move to expose EsoCorp.
6292코0=Marsgate
6293코0=The lengths he has taken to circumvent our detection not only by EsoCorp, but that of Mission Control as well, shows us painstakingly that we have failed him and probably many others like him. In their eyes we were playing for the other team. It puts us all to shame. Many citizens are showing their discontent with our Colony now that our own actions have been exposed, and back on Earth this whole ordeal is blowing up to mind boggling proportions. It has been dubbed “Marsgate” and we are accused of being compliant in the breaking of international and interplanetary treaties by the UN. @n@nPopular pressure has prompted that a trial start as quickly as possible. You will be required to defend our actions via satellite link.@n@n<effect>You can’t repair any more EsoCorp rovers.
7284코0=The cat’s out of the bag. One of our bolder Colonists took it upon himself to do what we couldn’t – expose EsoCorp and their dirty dealings on Mars.
7285코0=We only wanted to protect them, right?
7506코0=Marsgate has exploded. One of our citizens has exposed EsoCorp and our involvement in the affair.
6286코0=Marsgate: Wrong Side of History
6287코0=Joining the legal proceedings against the entity known as EsoCorp by satellite link is the head of the Mars Colony Project as a representative of <reg_param1> and the main victim in “Marsgate” other than the total disregarding of international and interplanetary treaties. The treaties, which are in place to discourage the militarization of any human endeavors in space, are held to be of utter importance by all present parties, except the defendant, and thus the transgression is seen as most grievous. @n@nBecause communication with Mars is not at its peak at this time and will take too long for a proper discussion, know that our sponsors have shared your overall stance on the whole affair. Still, as the final verdict draws near we have decided it best if you say in your own words the implications of EsoCorp’s secretive and illegal military testing operations on Mars. 
7286코0=The UN trial is about to start... I can already feel the water heating up.
6288코0=At the end of the day, it is Earth that has failed us by allowing this whole thing in the first place.
6289코0=You want the truth? You can’t handle the truth!
7287코0=Marsgate: The Blame Game
6296코0=EsoCorp put the lives of people, who brave an unforgiving world in the name of humanity, in danger with nothing more than profit in mind. We at Mission Control, on the other hand, are tasked with protecting the mission and the lives of all people taking part in it, so we did what we saw fit in order to see our duties are met. With guns pointing at our life support equipment and the closest help 3 million miles away, we were left with little choice and we stand by our decision. Why EsoCorp was able to send these rovers all the way to Mars without being detected from Earth is beyond us and we, the people of Mars, feel let down by Earth today.@n@n<effect><reg_param1> Colonists became Renegades.
7288코0=A tough moment. We tried our best not to fan the flames.
7289코0=Marsgate: What Can Change the Nature of Man?
6297코0=EsoCorp came to Mars with force, deployed in our vicinity, breaking every law and basically putting a gun to our heads. It was a classic story of the strong bullying the weak, or in this case, someone completely unprepared for such an event. In a way it was a stab in the back, as we idolized Earth as a source of safety while we had to wrestle with the unforgiving calamities of Mars. @n@nWe did not like it, but we came to the realization that it was only a matter of time before this happened and that it was better to have a strong ally. We are pioneers on a new frontier, opening countless possibilities and space for humans to be, well, humans. If it was not EsoCorp today, it would have been someone else tomorrow, I assure you. And that someone else might have come at different circumstances and not offered us, albeit indirectly, a way to stay on their good side. At the end of day, we may have changed planets, but we are still humans, with all the blessings and curses this fact carries in itself.@n@n<effect><reg_param1> Colonists became Renegades.
7290코0=This was bound to happen. We gave them the whole truth and nothing but the truth, whether they wanted it or not.
6294코0=OK
7507코0=The UN has shown some understanding of the difficult situation we were put in but has fined the Colony nonetheless. The resulting loss of reputation diverted many Applicants from the project.
6303코0=Marsgate: Missile Envy
6304코0=We can now build laser-targeting missile defense systems. This will help us mount a defense against the incoming attacks.
7291코0=Fight fire with fire! Well, rockets. You know what I mean.
6305코0=This ought to give us a fighting chance.
7508코0=In an attempt to counter the attacks we designed missile turrets tasked with repulsing all incoming attacks.
7292코0=<funding(reg_param1)>
8158코0=The Last War: Before The Storm
8159코0=We have devastating news from Earth!
8160코0=A chain of attacks has reduced to ruins major temples and landmarks in Southeast Asia. Preliminary estimates put the body count in the hundreds. @n@nDespite the scale of the attacks, the perpetrators are believed to be terrorists of a new kind. So far no one has taken responsibility as tensions are high and the blame game is in full swing. @n@nThere is still a lot of confusion. We will be following the events as they unfold.
8161코0=What a tragedy!
8162코0=Disturbing news from Earth! Terrorist attacks have disturbed the relative peace Earth currently enjoys.
8163코0=The Last War: As Tensions Rise
8164코0=In the wake of the attacks in Asia, many dormant grievances between the nations affected have been reignited - some of which go far back in time. 
8165코0=The UN has set out a tension meter as it warns that this situation has the potential to escalate into an all-out war if measures aren’t taken.@n @nThe goal of the meter is to try and give an objective representation of where things are now and to help us understand what works and what doesn’t. Everyone in the UN is asked to step in and do all they can to help calm the spirits.@n@nSo far we can see no adequate way to help from here.@n@n<effect>You must find ways to keep the tension from reaching 100%. Upon bringing tensions down to 0% the conflicts on Earth will be successfully resolved. Tensions will rise up from events that happen on Earth and are out of your control.
8166코0=We will be following the situation closely.
8167코0=The terrorist bombings are igniting tensions around the world. The UN has set out a tension meter and warns of a global conflict.
8168코0=The Last War: Peacemaker
8169코0=Our sponsor has informed us that it's now playing a major role in peacekeeping efforts. They are also providing humanitarian aid to vast territories that are affected by the crisis. 
8170코0=Millions have been displaced and food is of severe shortage. @n@nWe have been given a heads up that resource supply from Earth will soon become unavailable for an unspecified amount of time. Now all eyes on Earth are on <reg_param1> and there are those who will benefit greatly by branding them hypocritical in their commitment and intentions - hampering all progress towards peace.  @n@n<effect>Resupply with resources from Earth will be unavailable after 5 Sols. Take care to order any needed resources soon.
8171코0=We should brace ourselves for a tough time ahead.
8172코0=The Last War: Resupply Cutoff
8173코0=The supply embargo is now in effect.
8174코0=We must make do with what we can obtain by ourselves for however long a period this turns out to be. @n@n<effect>Resupply with resources is now unavailable.
8175코0=Conservation takes priority.
8176코0=Supply resources from Earth have temporarily been stopped.
8177코0=The Last War: Off-World Safety
8178코0=With millions of refugees, and governments reluctant to take in any at all, a humanitarian crisis on an unprecedented scale has developed. 
8179코0=Dug in our struggle to survive on Mars, we seem to have taken for granted that Earth - a place where there is enough of everything we need so desperately up here - is always there for us should we need it. Now that we have established a somewhat solid presence on Mars, and Earth seems to be in a dark place, it seems we may have the opportunity to return the favor.@n@n<reg_param1> has sent a request that we start accepting refugees. They hope this drastic measure to get people to safety will highlight the absurdity of regional governments not taking in refugees and put pressure on them by their own populace.@n@n<effect>20 Refugees want to join the Colony. Accepting them will decrease the War Tension, but could the colony support this additional population?
8180코0=Start planning.
8182코0=Refugees have arrived.
8183코0=The Last War: It Has Begun
8184코0=It has begun. The moment that seemed unthinkable less than a year ago.
8185코0=Regional conflicts have dragged the major powers on Earth to declare war on one another. Earth is now officially going through its Third World War. @n@nSo far no nuclear weapons are reported to have been used, and we pray to whatever gods are listening up here on Mars, that none will be used. But somewhere in the now abandoned halls of the UN building in New York, the Doomsday Clock sits in the dark - with its warning having fallen on deaf ears and its hands perilously close to midnight.@n@n<effect>All rockets are unavailable due to chaos on Earth.
8186코0=War, war never changes.
8187코0=Major powers declare war on one another - rockets are unavailable.
8188코0=The Last War: Supply Line Back
8189코0=We have received some good news, for a change!
8190코0=Among the chaos on Earth, our sponsor hasn't forgotten about us. They tell us that bad PR is the least of their concerns right now and we can once again request supply rockets from them. However, all resources are very scarce on Earth and will remain unavailable for us.@n@n<effect>Rockets from Earth are available once again. Resources are still unavailable.
8191코0=I have mixed feelings about this.
8545코0=Supply rockets are available once more, but not for resources.
8192코0=The Last War: Feeding the Hand That Feeds
8193코0=It may seem that Earth has been engulfed with slowly spreading madness, but there are those who haven’t lost their minds to the war craze, and are actively working to restore peace. 
8194코0=As major mining operations on Earth are easy targets for today’s weapons, <reg_param1> believes that a supply of Rare Metals from Mars will greatly help their peacekeeping efforts.@n@n<effect>You can now send Rare Metals to Earth to decrease War Tension, instead of receiving Funding. Rockets for the shipments will arrive regularly.
8195코0=Audit all our reserves and prepare for sending out supply missions to Earth!
8196코0=Trade rockets for Rare Metals will arrive periodically to reduce War Tension.
8197코0=The Last War: Earth Attacks!!!
8198코0=Our support for our sponsors has brought attention to us once more and now retaliation is imminent!
8199코0=Several objects that were in unspecified orbits around the Sun and not far from Mars have suddenly changed trajectory and are heading our way. All gathered observations point towards old dormant weapons from the time before the space weapon bans came into power.@n@n<effect>Our colony is being bombarded!@n<hint>MDS Lasers can protect the surrounding area from bombardment
8200코0=Prepare for bombardment!
8201코0=The Last War: Embracing the Void
8202코0=From out here, Earth is indeed a pale blue dot. It seems so peaceful and tranquil, yet the harrowing stories of those who have witnessed the recent events there point to a reality which is anything but.
8203코0=Millions of people want to flee Earth for the - what now looks like - relative safety of Mars. It is impossible to help them all, but we might endure the extra strain and save some more souls from the war and bring hope to all those we can’t.@n@n<effect>Even more refugees want to join the Colony. Accepting them will decrease the War Tension, but could the colony support this additional population?
8204코0=Help as many as we can - then help more!
8205코0=More refugees arrive on Mars.
8206코0=The Last War: Noah’s Ark
8207코0=We have been informed that even more refugees are being sent our way.
8208코0=One would argue this is an extreme and unpractical plan, not to mention the extra weight risks dooming the entire Mars project altogether. @n@nHowever, there are those who believe this is an effort to save as many people as possible from what some predict to be a war that ends humanity on Earth. @n@n<effect>Even more refugees want to come to Mars.
8209코0=Our resilience is being tested.
8181코0=Refugees fleeing from the conflicts on Earth want to join our colony.
8210코0=Even more refugees come to Mars.
8211코0=The Last War: The Grand Push
8212코0=There seems to be little time to stop the war from reaching a point of no return, yet time is all we have.
8213코0=After doing their best to avoid the war from happening, and ultimately failing to do so, <reg_param1> are now determined to see it through.@n@nA final desperate push to complete several separate projects is underway. The projects aim at dramatically shifting the projected direction of the war and bringing everybody to the table to discuss ending it once and for all.@n@nAs the war has ravaged most of Earth's resource infrastructure, <reg_param1> is asking we contribute resources they are short on and urge haste, certain they do not need to explain why.@n@n<effect>Supply the requested resources to decrease War Tension significantly. Be careful - the conflict on Earth is escalating and we have a limited time frame to resolve it.
8214코0=The future of Earth is pretty much in our hands now.
8215코0=The Last War: Time Passes
8216코0=Tackling the everyday challenges of Mars is a handful on its own, but we mustn't forget that our home world is currently on the brink of annihilation. 
8217코0=The narrow window of time we have to act will soon close and the fate of Earth, with which our own fate is very much intertwined with, will be out of our hands.@n@nWe must send the requested supplies to Earth as soon as possible! If we do not act with all haste, there may be no living soul left to receive them very soon.
8218코0=Time is of the essence.
8219코0=War Tension: <reg_param1>%
8220코0=The Last War: Doomsday Clock
8221코0=Tensions are rising at a rate faster than even the most pessimistic predictions.
8222코0=The UN has adopted the Doomsday Clock that the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists has used since the end of World War Two - to highlight how close humanity is to self-extinction. It is now set at Two Minutes to Midnight, a level at which it hasn’t been at since the early 21st century.
8223코0=Things are spiraling out of control.
8224코0=The Last War: Boiling Point
8225코0=We are officially One Minute to Midnight and most observers are bracing for a prolonged global war which now seems unavoidable.
8226코0=At this point hoping that no one resorts to weapons of mass destruction classifies you as an optimist.
8227코0=How did we get here?
8228코0=The Last War: Dire Situation
8229코0=The end of human civilization on Earth has never been closer.
8230코0=We are 80% on track and are still going at full speed on this downhill race towards Armageddon. Right now it seems we might be Earth's only hope. @n@nWe must step up our game and help our sponsor bring things to a conclusion in which the Earth is not scorched by a thousand nuclear detonations.@n@nMake no mistake - although we live our lives on a different world, our fate is very closely tied to that of our mother planet.
8231코0=Could this really be the end?
8232코0=The Last War: The Day After Tomorrow
8233코0=Silence… After a brief increase in brightness, everything has fallen silent.
8234코0=We are scrambling to re-establish communications with Earth, but for the first time no one seems to be listening. Deep down, everyone knows that the unfathomable has happened. @n@nThere is denial, there is depression, yet we all know… for the nature of the luminosity spike can be one thing and one thing only: utter nuclear devastation spread all over the globe.@n@nWe will keep on listening, maybe someday someone will talk back.@n@n<effect>Earth was devastated by the war. Export, Resupply, Research Outsourcing and Applicants have been disabled indefinitely.
8235코0=We are truly alone now.
8546코0=Earth is devastated by the war. Contact with our home planet is lost.
8236코0=The Last War: New World Order
8237코0=Today we received the call we've been hoping for!
8238코0=There are humans left on Earth and they are reemerging to form a new society.@n@nThey inform us that things are very different now and Earth will never be the same again. Things are much more difficult; the environment is harsher and sunlight is scarcer; there is little resource to go around and most technological advancements have been lost to nuclear fire.@n@nBut they see this as a means of a new clean beginning and have expressed their desire to cooperate with us, this time as true equals.@n@n<effect>Contact with Earth has been re-established. Rockets are available once again.
8239코0=A new chapter for all of humanity begins.
8547코0=A new society emerged from the ruins on Earth.
8240코0=Only united can we hope to conquer the void. (constrain War Tension increase to <ChoiceA_Tension>%)
8241코0=Earth won't change. (<ChoiceB_Applicants> new applicants; War Tension will increase by <ChoiceB_Tension>%)
8242코0=The Last War: Local Wars in the Third World
8243코0=The ripples made by the attacks on Earth have toppled governments and paved the way for opportunists to ride a wave of populist fury.
8244코0=Border skirmishes are slowly spilling into full scale invasions and the major powers are so far failing to instate a cease fire. The relative peace Earth has been enjoying for the past century now seems to have been a fragile facade, beneath which grudges and ambitions have been festering in wait for the right moment. @n@nThe organization responsible has all but vanished after accomplishing more that it could have possibly hoped for. @n@nWe, on the other hand, as a symbol of what humanity can achieve when working together and not by fighting between ourselves, are in an unique position to make a statement which may be of actual merit to the situation.
8284코0=Wildfire: Infection!
8285코0=We have received a disturbing medical report. A number of colonists have contracted an unknown disease.
8286코0=The medical examination shows they all suffer from a form of hypercoagulation. Anti-coagulation medicines have been issued but the symptoms remain. Primary analysis of the patients’ blood samples hasn't found the cause behind the symptoms, but the level of damage to the erythrocytes leads to the workings of a virus-sized or smaller agent. We’re currently running a thorough check on the patients’ background information and behavior to find the source of the infection.@n@n<effect>Several Colonists have gained the Infected trait.
8287코0=I’ll inform Earth Control to enact decontamination protocols on any cargo we send.
8288코0=Some Colonists have contracted a mysterious infection. It's spreading rapidly across the colony.
8289코0=Wildfire: Quenching the Flames
8290코0=So far the bizarre nature of the infection has defeated all of our attempts to stop it. Yet time is growing short as more and more people are getting sick.
8291코0=The challenge would be monumental as our researchers lack any epidemiological data on which to step up. The medical records we’ve gathered point out the symptoms, but the chemical structure of the agent is so alien that it cannot be compared to anything known to science. To make things worse, the nano-scale of the agent makes analysis even harder. Only by diverting enough resources to the task we can hope to make any breakthrough.@n@n<effect>The <em>Wildfire Cure</em> research has become available.@n<hint>Each newly constructed Medical Building will grant a 5% Tech Boost to the Wildfire Cure research (maximum 50%).
8292코0=Finally, a glimmer of hope!
8475코0=Our scientists have devised a complex plan to discover the cure for the Wildfire infection. It would be a monumental effort but we must prioritize the research to be able to find a solution to the growing crisis.
8550코0=Constructing new Medical buildings which gather data about the infection could speed up the progress towards discovering the Wildfire Cure.
8293코0=Wildfire: The Cure
8294코0=Tremendous news! The cure for the Wildfire disease has been discovered!
8295코0=A genetically modified strain of the Martian Wildfire interfaces with the RNA of the virus and effectively stops it from coagulating the blood plasma of the host. The intake of only a small amount of the cure is enough to halt the development of the disease, even though it wouldn't repair the tissue damage suffered so far.@n@nThe scientists experimented with multiple growth mediums and discovered that the most effective way to proliferate the medicine is by introducing it in mold cells growing on potatoes. This is great news because we can provide enough biomass for the modified mold to grow and if we do it quickly, we can still stand a chance to end the suffering on Earth.@n@n<effect>The Curetato Crop has become available. Harvesting it will produce Cure for the Wildfire infection, which in turn has to be exported to Earth to end the crisis.@n@n<effect> Colonists with the Infected trait will be cured permanently after their first visit in a Medical Building.
8296코0=Start the process immediately. Time is of the essence!
8476코0=The Cure for Wildfire has been discovered! Conveniently spliced in modified mold cells, the cure can be grown on plant biomass. We have to produce it en masse!
5614코0=Anomaly Analyzed
8297코0=The faint distress signal led us to the burial site of a small satellite. It had fallen deep under the red sands and could have been there for an eternity.
8298코0=It’s strange that we couldn't find any information for the flight in the international records. No black box nor signatures can be seen except for a discolored logo, ‘Scoop XI’. Upon opening the hull we found all of the internal systems corroded away by time, with only a small capsule remaining. The biohazard sign on it only served to stir our curiosity, but a closer examination discovered that it has been breached. We assume that the biological material inside has been destroyed. We have ordered the Rover to store the salvage for further analysis.
8299코0=A curious find. Let’s hope the future will bring more answers than questions on that matter.
8300코0=Wildfire: Contamination!
8301코0=We've just lost one of our scientific facilities in a disturbing set of events. We’re still investigating the cause of the disaster but there are clues which lead to unsettling conclusions.
8302코0=The security log shows that everything started with a malfunction in the storage unit where the analysis samples were stored. After that the internal systems of the laboratory began to rapidly fail one after another. Suspiciously, the damaged systems were all made of plastic and organic polymers, all corroded away within mere seconds.@n@nOur operatives are puzzled with the cause of the chain reaction but the Chief Engineer has pointed out a fact which eluded our attention until now – the remains of the Scoop XI satellite were held in the storage unit of this facility. We didn't take any chances and ordered an emergency decontamination of the building. Let’s hope that whatever was in there has been destroyed.@n@n<effect>A Laboratory has mysteriously malfunctioned.
8303코0=Monitor the colony and report any related cases.
8304코0=Wildfire: Mars Aflame
8305코0=We have to face it – we cannot stop the infection. No matter what we do it keeps spreading across the colony like a wildfire. Hence the name we've given it.
8306코0=All attempts to isolate the sources have failed. We can assume that the virus is traveling all across our life support and maintenance circuits. The only way to stop it is to turn off all systems, but this would be a death sentence for the colonists. We've ran out of options.
8307코0=Don't despair, we will find a solution!
8477코0=The infection is spreading at alarming rate through the colony. The scientists have named it Wildfire after its virulence and infection pattern.
8309코0=The worst has happened – Wildfire has infected Earth. It was on board a rocket which returned to Earth and somehow it breached through all decontamination measures.
8310코0=The infected personnel at the landing site deteriorated within hours of contracting the infection and the medics couldn't help them. This doesn't match our medical records as Wildfire takes much more time to develop here, on Mars. We suspect a form of rapid mutation due to the changes in the environment.@n@nThe rocket landing site has been placed under quarantine and the authorities have been informed. We can only pray that they manage to prevent the infection from spreading any further.@n@n<effect>Infection Level on Earth has been set to the Contained level. If it reaches the Extinction level, the human population on Earth will be obliterated. Discover the Wildfire Cure and supply it to Earth to prevent this!
8478코0=One of our rockets has spread the Wildfire infection on Earth. It's spreading rapidly - we have to discover the Cure before the human population on Earth is obliterated!
8308코0=Wildfire: Countdown to Extinction
8312코0=The worst has happened – Wildfire has infected Earth. We suspect this was caused by a recent meteor impact on Mars which lifted debris and showered them on the Blue Planet.
8313코0=Several small settlements in different regions have been infected. The authorities report that the victims have deteriorated within mere hours, something which doesn't match our medical records. On Mars it takes Sols for the Wildfire to kill its host. We suspect some form of rapid mutation due to the changes in the environment.@n@nThe infected areas have been placed under quarantine and we can only pray that the authorities manage to prevent the disease from spreading any further.@n@n<effect>Infection Level on Earth has been set to the Contained level. If it reaches the Extinction level, the human population on Earth will be obliterated. Discover the Wildfire Cure and supply it to Earth to prevent this!
8311코0=Cosmos help us all!
8479코0=Martian meteors have spread the Wildfire infection on Earth! We must discover the Cure before the entire human population on Earth is obliterated!
8314코0=Contained
8315코0=Endemic
8316코0=Epidemic
8317코0=Pandemic
8318코0=Doomsday
8319코0=Wildfire: Infection Level - Endemic
8320코0=The Wildfire virus is spreading on Earth at an alarming rate, threatening entire populations all over the globe. The grim prediction is that soon the entire population of the planet will be affected.
8321코0=Scientists on Earth are desperately trying to discover a solution, but so far in vain. The virulence of the local strain is so high that sampling and transporting infected material is a death sentence. The nanoscopic size of the agent makes containment equally hard - biological filters fail to stop it effectively, threatening the safety of any laboratory which attempts to study it. The only solution is to analyze the original strain - the one we have on Mars - in order to find the cure. Time is running short!@n@nMeanwhile, Third World countries are in a state of panic as the Wildfire strikes the poorest communities. Waves of refugees flee the affected regions and many resource operations are simply abandoned by the scared personnel. The market feels the hunger for raw resources and multiple demands have been filed for imports from Mars.@n@n<effect>Infection Level has reached the Endemic state. Export prices have increased for the next <text_param1> Sols as the First World economies feel the hunger for resources.
8634코0=15
8322코0=Grave news... We have to hurry!
8480코0=The Wildfire infection is spreading uncontrollably on Earth. The Third World countries are hit harder due to their lack of resources to fight the disease effectively.
8323코0=Wildfire: Infection Level - Epidemic
8324코0=Panic and desperation has spread across the population as waves of refugees flee the endemic zones.
8325코0=Wildfire has hit the Third World hard. The crisis can be felt across the developing countries and the First World as well. The chaos in the poorest countries resonates across the globe as the raw materials markets are plummeting. Entire resource operations in the Third World countries are abandoned as the workers flee the areas hit by the virus.

8332코0=Our sensors detect no signs of human activity on the surface of Earth. We must admit that the battle with the Wildfire infection is lost. Night falls over humankind.
8333코0=Earth has become an uninhabited mausoleum of our past greatness - the barren, lifeless husks of the once overcrowded megalopolises, the abandoned derelicts of our once great industrial might, the meadows where no children would ever play. The shroud of silence has covered the surface of the Earth and only the wind chimes through the ruins of our past, whispering stories no one is there to listen.@n@nIs this the end? Is the Wildfire infection over, dead in its rampant destruction alongside its human hosts? Or would it mutate further, consuming all life on Earth? Only the children of our children will be able to answer these questions, watching from afar.@n@n<effect>Earth population is devastated by the Wildfire infection!

They are unsure what happened with the disease, and so are we, but they claim that it appears gone. Earth is welcoming to humans once more!@n@nThe survivors have just began restarting abandoned factory complexes and power plants to fuel the industry needed to rebuild the civilization from the ruins. People move into the cities and repopulate the farming areas. The economy is starting to build up momentum – and they want us to become part of the exchange once more!@n@nThe survivors have their spirits high, but still the fear of the Wildfire lies in all of them – what if it comes back? This is the reason why they’ve requested us to send them as much of the Wildfire Cure as we can.@n@n<effect>Communications with Earth have been re-established.

8345코0=Authorities all over the Earth report that no cases of the Wildfire infection have been detected. Earth is freed from the yoke of the worst pandemic in history.
8346코0=People all around the world celebrate, but the consequences of the Wildfire crisis remain. We have decades – maybe even centuries before us – to cope with the damages caused, with the fear and desperation which reverberate inside all of us. But we remain optimistic that, given time, people will return to their everyday lives.@n@nThe Wildfire crisis has shown us how fragile we are, how the ivory towers we’ve built could crumble in mere days. Maybe it’s the perfect moment to step back and reconsider the way we lived our lives. To rebuild our civilization, but build it better than before.@n@nThe Wildfire Cure remains our hot lead towards the way the disease worked. By studying it we will be able to delve in the mystery of its structure and origin, preparing for worse days ahead.@n@n<effect>The infection on Earth has been eradicated! All Infection Level effects have been removed.@n@n<effect>Cargo Rockets will be sent from Earth to load Wildfire Cure.

8355코0=Wildfire: Safer Together
8352코0=Today marks the moment when our colony is free from the threat of the Wildfire infection!
8356코0=Our efficient medical program has managed to cure all cases of the Wildfire infection. Mars has become a much safer place. We informed Earth and after a careful selection and medical checks they are ready to launch an emergency flight with healthy survivors aboard.@n@nThese are ordinary people who survived the Wildfire crisis somehow and managed to get to safety. None of them has passed the initial training required for arriving on Mars so we expect them to have a hard time acclimating to the life in the colony.

I’m certain my vision resonates with all of you up there; after all - you are a part of it.@n@nMy Beyond Earth initiative is pushing several separate projects simultaneously - all aimed at bringing prosperity and peace to a human race spread across the Solar System.@n@nOne of the projects in question is currently in a ditch - the planning of a Moon base to mine Hydrogen 3, called Aldrin Base. I’m certain I don’t need to tell you what an abundance of the material would mean energy-wise. I’d kindly implore you, if your situation permits it of course, to contribute some research capacity and quite frankly know-how to the Beyond Earth initiative.@n@n<effect>Beyond Earth Initiative tech unlocked.

8426코0=We have received grave news from Earth. It seems Rede Goddenberry has fallen ill and doesn’t have much time left.
8427코0=The billionaire has sent a special request out to us:@n@n“It seems I can no longer hide the fact that I am and have been dying in these recent months. Although this may explain my push for haste in the completion of the Beyond Earth initiative to some, the reality is that it's badly needed with or without my condition in mind.@n@nPeople are suffering and dying on Earth - in war, from deceases, from malnutrition. All of this is not necessary and my vision will remedy all of it, once complete.@n@nSo I convey this message to you, whom I have come to see as my closest partners in this endeavor: Please redouble your efforts, for it would please a dying old man greatly to see the plan bearing fruit before his death. But if not to warm my old heart, do it because you believe in what the initiative represents as I know you do.“

8429코0=Beyond Earth: Rede Goddenberry has passed away
8430코0=Today we received news of Rede Goddenberry’s passing. We are all deeply saddened by this loss.
8431코0=But we are still inspired by his vision - a vision where humanity travels free amidst the worlds of a unified Solar System. @n@nAlthough Goddenberry’s death will dissuade many of his current partners to see the completion of the Beyond Earth initiative, we just may bring the plan to full or at least partial realization before other parties quit their involvement.
8432코0=We must see this through!
8559코0=Rede Goddenberry passes away.
8433코0=Beyond Earth: The Dream is Dead
8434코0=Following Rede Goddenberry’s death, all of his former partners from Beyond Earth have since abandoned the initiative.
8435코0=We have failed to persuade them without the uniting effect of his utopic vision spearheaded by himself alone. @n@nThe different gains in space exploration and asteroid mining will not simply disappear but are being bought off and pushed towards partial completion by various Earth-based corporations that will exploit them for personal profit and show no signs of desire to contribute to what was Rede Goddenberry’s vision of a united humanity.@n@nIn the end, history will remember him as an old eccentric billionaire who tried to swim upstream for humanity’s sake but ended up solidifying the rule of massive corporations that are more interested in profits than in an idealistic future.
8436코0=We have failed everyone...
8437코0=Rede Goddenberry's plan falls apart as previous partners leave the initiative after his passing.
8442코0=Beyond Earth: Disaster Strikes
8443코0=There was a terrible accident at the Port Vesta project site.
8444코0=A strong solar flare erupted without a sufficient head warning. There are 23 confirmed casualties.@n@nThe solar flare erupted during a short window of vulnerability, when Port Vesta had no operational means of shielding against such an event. If it had happened just a bit later, the defenses would've been operational.@n@nSadly the damage is massive in scale. The project suffered a major setback.
8445코0=A tragedy indeed, but we will overcome this setback.
8560코0=Beyond Earth: Sabotage
8561코0=News of sabotage at the Aldrin Base mining facility on the Moon has just been made public. Luckily, there are no fatalities.
8562코0=The project has suffered a major setback. Below is Mr Goddenberry’s statement:@n@n“What the Beyond Earth initiative is striving to ultimately achieve is change - change that will make inter-human rivalry a thing of the past. @n@nAs with all change, there will be resistance. There are those who prosper from wars, from suffering. And they see a united humanity as a threat, for they will be left behind.@n@nTo them I have to say: the world is moving on. Try as you might, you have only slowed down an irreversible process.”

Colonists can be healed in Medical Buildings in a powered Dome, but only if they are provided with Food, Water and Oxygen. Colonists can't work at low health unless they’re Fit.
4293코0=Sanity
4294코0=Represents mental condition. Lowered by working on a heavy workload, in outside buildings and during dark hours, witnessing the death of a Colonist living in the same Residence or various Martian disasters. Recovered when resting at home and by visiting certain Service Buildings.
4295코0=Comfort
4296코0=Residences and visited buildings improve Comfort up to their Service Comfort value, but Colonists will try to visit only buildings that correspond to their interests. Colonists are more inclined to have children at higher Comfort. Earthborn Colonists whose Comfort is depleted will quit their job and leave the Colony at first opportunity.
4297코0=Morale

8247코0=The Last War: Too Many Unnatural Deaths
8248코0=Be it from the extra influx of colonists, the shortage of help from Earth or other reasons all together, the number of recently perished colonists by unnatural causes is disturbing. 
8249코0=People on Earth have been served a grim reminder that although far from the massive problems that they are experiencing right now, Mars is far from the safe heaven many have probably fooled themselves into believing.@n@n<effect>Too many colonists have died recently from unnatural causes. The War Tension has increased.
8250코0=A sad day for humanity.
8251코0=Send Rare Metals to Earth to decrease War Tension, instead of receiving Funding. Rockets for the shipments will arrive regularly.
8252코0=Rare Metals Rocket
8253코0=Submit to UN inspection. (-<ChoiceA_MoralePenalty> Morale to all colonists)
8254코0=Deny allegations. (+<ChoiceB_TensionIncrease>% War Tension)
8255코0=The Last War: Closer to Home
8256코0=A blatant lie is gaining traction on Earth.
8257코0=A faction in the wars on Earth, an alliance of several smaller states, has come out and outright accused <reg_param1> of using the Mars project as a backdrop for developing and testing forbidden weapons, which are then used on their people.   @n@nThe UN has requested that we allow a probe to be made so this nonsense is cleared, although we fear that instilling such doubts in our colonists may have an impact on morale as a whole.@n@nWhat do we do?
8258코0=<red>UN inspection -10</red>
8259코0=I thought we lived in more enlightened times. (+<Tension>% War Tension)
8260코0=You do know this comet was predicted to come this close to Earth 50 years ago, right? (+<Tension>% War Tension)
8261코0=Earth has changed a lot since we departed for Mars, and not for the better. (+<Tension>% War Tension)
8262코0=Of course it's an omen. How could it possibly be anything but? (+<Tension>% War Tension)
8263코0=The Last War: Comet Sighted!
8264코0=A comet suddenly lit up night skies above Earth, visible from all over the globe. 
8265코0=Although the comet is well known and talked about by most space agencies, in the current atmosphere on Earth people have little time for space news and have chosen to see an omen in it. @n@nMost interpretations have been that victory is imminent for the interpreter, but more alarmingly many believe this is a sign of the end times. @n@nSome have chosen to embrace it… risking this becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.@n@nWe have to talk some sense into the Earthlings.
8245코0=<reg_param1> safely landed in the colony.
8246코0=<reg_param1> have suffocated in orbit.

8276코0=The Last War: Cold War 2.0
8277코0=Ceasefires are taking effect and armies are pulling back behind borders.
8278코0=Mistrust and disbelief is rampant and while the guns are finally silent, the road to healing the wounds of war will be longer than anything Earth has ever experienced before. @n@nMillions have perished and those who survived will suffer a divide so huge, it seems impossible to fill. @n@nIn what almost seems as an apathetic effort to move on, <reg_param1> has informed us that we are to continue the project and its business as usual – with the exception that now everything costs more after the devastation on Earth.@n@n<effect>Resupply prices increased by 50% for the next 50 Sols.
8279코0=Earth survived, but at what cost?
8548코0=A ceasefire was signed, but Earth is caught in the grip of a new Cold War. All resupply prices have been increased.
8549코0=The war is over! Sound minds and human compassion emerged victorious.
8280코0=The Last War: Peace-keepers Prevail!
8281코0=Hatred has lost! Sound minds and human compassion emerge victorious. 
8282코0=The Drums of War have ceased their relentless beating and those who survived the wars are looking at the death and destruction it caused. @n@nNever has it been so obvious how little a spark can wipe out our race once and for all and this has reached the heart of every human soul on Earth. @n@nAs the dead and fallen are being honored, pacts and treaties, forged with compassion and good will, are being signed all over the globe. Our colony on Mars and <reg_param1> have been identified as champions of this peace.@n@nWe have received the Honor of Hope and have become the symbol of humanity, closer to everyone’s hearts and minds than ever before. Every nation wishes to repay us in any way possible. @n@n<effect>A spike of applicants and a dramatic reduction in prices are the short term benefits we are promised to expect.@n@n<effect>Gained a new Technology, <em><reg_param2></em>.
8283코0=Celebrate, but never forget!
